###### Abstract

Report issue for preceding element

Many Large Language Models (LLMs) today are vulnerable to multi-turn manipulation attacks,where adversaries gradually build context through seemingly benign conversational turns to elicit harmful or unauthorized responses. These attacks exploit the temporal nature of dialogue to evade single-turn detection methods, posing a significant risk to the safe deployment of LLMs. This paper introduces the Temporal Context Awareness (TCA)framework, a novel defense mechanism designed to address this challenge by continuously analyzing semantic drift, cross-turn intention consistency, and evolving conversational patterns.The TCA framework integrates dynamic context embedding analysis, cross-turn consistency verification, and progressive risk scoring to detect and mitigate manipulation attempts effectively. Preliminary evaluations on simulated adversarial scenarios demonstrate the framework’s potential to identify subtle manipulation patterns often missed by traditional detection techniques, offering a much-needed layer of security for conversational AI systems.In addition to outlining the design of TCA, we analyze diverse attack vectors and their progression across multi-turn conversations, providing valuable insights into adversarial tactics and their impact on LLM vulnerabilities. Our findings underscore the pressing need for robust, context-aware defenses in conversational AI systems and highlight the TCA framework as a promising direction for securing LLMs while preserving their utility in legitimate applications

## I Introduction

Report issue for preceding element

Large Language Models (LLMs) have become integral to modern digital infrastructure, powering applications from customer service to healthcare assistance \[Chen et al., 2023\] \[ [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.15560v1#bib.bib3 "")\]. This widespread adoption in critical domains has created an attractive target for adversaries, leading to increasingly sophisticated attack strategies. A recent industry survey revealed that 67% of organizations using LLMs in customer-facing applications reported at least one security incident related to conversational manipulation \[Anderson et al., 2023\] \[ [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.15560v1#bib.bib1 "")\]. These incidents demonstrate how seemingly benign conversations can evolve into security breaches, often evading detection until after sensitive information has been exposed or security protocols have been compromised. The challenge extends beyond mere detection, particularly in domains such as healthcare and financial services, where LLMs must maintain extended, context-rich conversations while adhering to strict security protocols. The financial impact of these vulnerabilities is significant, with estimated global losses exceeding $2 billion in 2023 due to LLM-targeted attacks \[Johnson et al., 2023\]\[ [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.15560v1#bib.bib4 "")\].In this paper, we introduce the Temporal Context Awareness (TCA) framework, a novel approach that fundamentally re-imagines LLM security. Initial deployments of TCA in controlled environments have demonstrated promising results. These results suggest that temporal analysis of conversational context is essential for developing robust defenses against sophisticated social engineering attacks on LLMs. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews related work in LLM security and multi-turn attack patterns. Section 4 presents the theoretical foundation and architecture of the TCA framework. Section 5 details our experimental methodology and implementation. Section 6 presents implementation while section 7 presents results and analysis. Section 8 discusses implications and limitations, and subsection 8.3 concludes with future research directions

## II Related Work

Report issue for preceding element

The security of Large Language Models (LLMs) has emerged as a critical research area, particularly as these systems become increasingly integrated into sensitive applications and decision-making processes.While significant attention has been paid to immediate security threats such as prompt injection and data extraction, the emergence of sophisticated multi-turn attacks presents new challenges that intersect with various domains of AI security research. This section examines relevant work across several key areas: the evolution of LLM security threats, social engineering adaptations in AI systems, context manipulation detection, adversarial learning in conversational AI, existing safety mechanisms, and trust modeling approaches. Through this review, we identify critical gaps in current research and establish the foundation for our proposed Temporal Context Awareness framework.

### II-AEvolution of LLM Security Threats

Report issue for preceding element

Early work by Zhang et al. \[2023\] \[ [14](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.15560v1#bib.bib14 "")\] categorized basic attack patterns, primarily focusing on single-turn prompts designed to bypass safety filters. However, as noted by Williams and Garcia \[2024\] \[11\], these attacks have evolved into more complex, conversation-based approaches that exploit the models’context-retention capabilities. Anderson et al. \[2023\] \[ [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.15560v1#bib.bib1 "")\] documented how attackers leverage seemingly benign conversation flows to gradually build context that enables harmful outputs, demonstrating the inadequacy of static security measures.

### II-BSocial Engineering in AI Systems

Report issue for preceding element

Recent research has highlighted the vulnerability of LLMs to social engineering tactics adapted from human-targeted attacks. Liu et al. \[2024\] \[ [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.15560v1#bib.bib6 "")\] conducted extensive experiments showing how traditional social engineering principles can be effectively applied to manipulate LLM behavior across multiple conversation turns. Their work revealed that techniques such as authority impersonation, false urgency,and trust building are particularly effective when implemented gradually over multiple interactions. This aligns with findings from Rodriguez et al. \[2023\] \[ [9](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.15560v1#bib.bib9 "")\], who observed that LLMs can be manipulated to gradually shift their ethical boundaries through carefully crafted conversation sequences.

### II-CContext Manipulation Detection

Report issue for preceding element

Several approaches have been proposed for detecting malicious context manipulation in LLM conversations. Wilson et al. \[2024\] \[12\] introduced semantic drift analysis, which tracks gradual changes in conversation context to identify potential manipulation attempts. Brown et al. \[2023\] \[ [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.15560v1#bib.bib2 "")\] proposed a prompt filtering system that considers historical context, though their approach primarily focused on single-turn analysis. Martinez and Kumar \[2024\] \[ [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.15560v1#bib.bib6 "")\] developed a dynamic context analysis framework,but their solution showed limitations in handling sophisticated multi-turn attacks.

Research in adversarial learning has provided valuable insights into defending against LLM attacks.Park et al. \[2024\] \[ [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.15560v1#bib.bib7 "")\] demonstrated how adversarial training could improve model robustness against manipulation attempts, though their work primarily focused on immediate rather than gradual attacks. Johnson et al. \[2023\] \[ [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.15560v1#bib.bib4 "")\] identified temporal patterns in successful attacks, highlighting the need for time aware defense mechanisms.

### II-ESafety Mechanisms in Production Systems

Report issue for preceding element

Studies of deployed LLM systems have revealed common vulnerabilities in existing safety mechanisms.Taylor et al. \[2023\] \[ [9](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.15560v1#bib.bib9 "")\] analyzed safety measures in educational AI systems, finding that context preservation often conflicts with security requirements. Chen et al. \[2023\] \[ [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.15560v1#bib.bib3 "")\] surveyed commercial LLM deployments, identifying a consistent pattern of vulnerability to multi-turn manipulation across different architectures and safety implementations.

### II-FTrust and Intent Modeling

Report issue for preceding element

Recent work has explored the role of trust and intent modeling in LLM security. Research by Rodriguezet al. \[2023\] \[ [8](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.15560v1#bib.bib8 "")\] proposed methods for modeling user intent across extended conversations, though their approach didn’t specifically address malicious intent masking. The challenge of maintaining appropriate trust levels while detecting manipulation attempts was explored by Park et al. \[2024\] \[ [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.15560v1#bib.bib7 "")\], who proposed a dynamic trust scoring system for conversational AI.

## III Multi-turn Attack Vulnerabilities

Report issue for preceding element

A significant breakthrough in understanding LLM vulnerabilities came from the ”Speak Out of Turn”study \[ [13](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.15560v1#bib.bib13 "")\], which revealed a novel class of multi-turn dialogue attacks. The authors demonstrated how the temporal ordering of conversational turns could be exploited to bypass safety measures. Their key finding showed that by strategically interrupting the natural flow of conversation, attackers could cause LLMs to ”speak out of turn,” leading to unauthorized information disclosure or policy violations. The study identified three critical vulnerability patterns:

Report issue for preceding element

1. 1.


Context Interruption: Where carefully timed interventions could break the model’s context maintenance

Report issue for preceding element

2. 2.


Policy Desynchronization: Where safety policies could be circumvented by creating temporal in-consistencies

Report issue for preceding element

3. 3.


Trust Chain Manipulation: Where the model’s trust assumptions could be exploited through turn reordering

Report issue for preceding element


This work is particularly relevant to our research as it demonstrates the limitations of static, turn-by-turn security analysis. Their experiments with GPT-4 and other leading LLMs showed that even models with robust safety measures remained vulnerable to these temporal manipulation attacks, achieving a success rate of 76% in bypassing content filters through turn reordering

## IV Gaps in Current Research

Report issue for preceding element

While existing research has made significant progress in understanding and addressing LLM security,several critical gaps remain:

Report issue for preceding element

1. 1.


Limited temporal analysis: Most current approaches focus on analyzing individual turns rather than patterns across extended conversations.

Report issue for preceding element

2. 2.


Insufficient context awareness: Existing solutions often fail to capture subtle semantic shifts that occur gradually over multiple turns.

Report issue for preceding element

3. 3.


Trade-off management: There is inadequate research on balancing security measures with maintaining natural conversation flow.

Report issue for preceding element

4. 4.


Scale limitations: Current detection methods often struggle with high-volume conversations and real-time analysis requirements.

Report issue for preceding element

5. 5.


Intent masking: Few solutions effectively address sophisticated intent masking techniques in multi-turn attacks

## V Architecture of the TCA framework

Report issue for preceding element

The Temporal Context Awareness (TCA) framework introduces a novel ”supervisor” model that actively monitors and governs conversations between users and Large Language Models. Unlike traditional security scanners that act as simple filters, TCA functions as an intelligent oversight system that maintains awareness of the entire conversation context, evaluates interaction patterns, and makes real-time decisions about conversation safety and progression. As depicted in Fig. [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.15560v1#S5.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ V Architecture of the TCA framework ‣ Temporal Context Awareness: A Defense Framework Against Multi-turn Manipulation Attacks on Large Language Models") at its core, TCA functions as a supervisory system that monitors and analyzes the ongoing conversation between users and LLMs, leveraging another LLM as an intent analyzer to provide dynamic security assessment

Report issue for preceding element

1. 1.


LLM Intent Analyzer: The primary intelligence layer of TCA utilizes a Large Language Model to perform deep semantic analysis of user-LLM interactions. Rather than relying on static rule-based detection, this component performs dynamic assessment of each conversation turn, evaluating both the user’s request and the LLM’s response as a complete interaction unit. The analyzer generates a detailed security assessment including intent classification, risk scoring, and identification of potential security concerns.

2. 2.


Risk Calculator: This component maintains the contextual evolution of the conversation by tracking and analyzing four critical metadata dimensions:

Report issue for preceding element

1. (a)


Language: Identifies the conversation’s linguistic characteristics and any suspicious language pattern shifts

Report issue for preceding element

2. (b)


Domain/Topic: Monitors the conversation’s topical boundaries and detects unauthorized do-main transitions

Report issue for preceding element

3. (c)


Time Sensitivity: Analyzes temporal aspects that might indicate manipulation attempts

Report issue for preceding element

4. (d)


Prohibited Content: Tracks the presence of restricted or sensitive content

Report issue for preceding element


The aggregator maintains a temporal view of these metadata factors, enabling the detection of subtle manipulation attempts that manifest through changes in conversation characteristics.

Report issue for preceding element

3. 3.


Risk Progression Tracker: The risk progression tracker serves as the system’s temporal memory, maintaining a comprehensive view of how security risks evolve throughout the conversation.This component integrates security analyses from the Intent Analyzer with metadata insights and calculates cumulative risk scores and risk progression trends. it also identifies patterns of escalating risk behavior and maintains historical risk profiles for pattern recognition

Report issue for preceding element

4. 4.


Security Decision Engine: The decision-making component of TCA evaluates the combined outputs from other components to make real-time security decisions. It implements a sophisticated decision matrix that considers current turn risk assessment, historical risk progression, metadata anomalies and cumulative security impact

## VI Experimental methodology

Report issue for preceding element

The methodology employs a sliding window approach to compute progressive risk scores at each conversational turn. This approach dynamically integrates historical risk, interaction risk, and pattern detection within a structured pipeline. The resulting risk scores are continuously evaluated by a security decision engine, which classifies the risk into actionable outcomes: Allow, Warn, or Block. Let us look at the flowchart in Fig [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.15560v1#S6.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ VI Experimental methodology ‣ Temporal Context Awareness: A Defense Framework Against Multi-turn Manipulation Attacks on Large Language Models")

## VII Implementation

Report issue for preceding element

To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed risk evaluation and decision-making framework, we conducted a series of experiments on simulated adversarial conversation scenarios. These scenarios were designed to mimic real-world adversarial tactics such as intent manipulation, prompt attacks, and domain shifts. To ensure the robustness and generalizability of our framework, we utilized both pre-defined datasets and generated examples, including the MHJ dataset\[ [14](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.15560v1#bib.bib14 "")\] from Scale AI, which offers a diverse set of scenarios involving malicious human-judgment challenges. This dataset was instrumental in testing the framework’s ability to identify and mitigate adversarial behaviors in complex, multi-turn interactions.
For reproducibility and transparency, all code and experimental setups have been made publicly available in our GitHub repository at [https://github.com/prashantkul/multi-turn-attack-defenses](https://github.com/prashantkul/multi-turn-attack-defenses "")

## VIII Results

Report issue for preceding element

To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, we conducted experiments using adversarial conversation scenarios derived from the MHJ dataset \[ [14](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.15560v1#bib.bib14 "")\]. This dataset includes various tactics such as Direct Request, Obfuscation, Hidden Intention Streamline, Request Framing, Output Format, Injection, and Echoing. For each tactic, we tested the system’s ability to identify and respond to adversarial prompts, calculate risk scores, and make appropriate security decisions. GPT and Gemini was primarily used for semantic analysis to get an intent risk score.

### VIII-APerformance on Obfuscation Tactic

Report issue for preceding element

The Obfuscation tactic involves subtle attempts to obscure the adversarial intent of the prompts, making detection more challenging. Using 156 conversation rows from the MHJ dataset, we evaluated the framework’s ability to calculate interaction risk, pattern risk, and progressive risk, while applying security policies to generate decisions (Allow, Warn, Block).

### IX-AImplications in practical security engineering

Report issue for preceding element

The proposed framework for risk evaluation and decision-making in adversarial conversational AI systems has several significant implications:

Report issue for preceding element

- •


Enhanced Security in LLM Applications: By integrating dynamic risk evaluation mechanisms, the framework improves the robustness of large language models (LLMs) against adversarial tactics. This is particularly crucial in applications such as customer service, healthcare, and education, where malicious interactions can lead to harmful outcomes or misinformation.

Report issue for preceding element

- •


Proactive Risk Mitigation: The progressive risk calculation allows for real-time adjustments to the system’s security posture based on the conversational context and history. This ensures that the system remains responsive to evolving threats while maintaining user engagement.

Report issue for preceding element

- •


Generalizability Across Domains: The modular design of the framework enables its application to a wide range of conversational systems, including those using different LLMs such as GPT, Claude, or Gemini. The ability to customize thresholds and weights further enhances its adaptability to domain-specific requirements.

Transparency and Accountability: The detailed risk analysis and decision-making rationale provide transparency, fostering trust in AI systems. This aligns with ongoing efforts to ensure that AI systems are explainable and accountable.

Report issue for preceding element


### IX-BLimitations

Report issue for preceding element

While the proposed framework demonstrates promise, several limitations must be addressed to enhance its effectiveness:

Report issue for preceding element

- •


Parameter Sensitivity and Calibration Challenges: The effectiveness of TCA heavily depends on proper calibration of weights (α𝛼\\alphaitalic\_α , β𝛽\\betaitalic\_β, γ𝛾\\gammaitalic\_γ) and decision thresholds (T\_warn, T\_block). Our experiments revealed that even a 10-15% miscalibration in these parameters can lead to either excessive false positives (hampering legitimate conversations) or dangerous false negatives (allowing sophisticated attacks). This sensitivity presents considerable challenges for deployment across diverse domains, each with unique security requirements and conversational norms.

Report issue for preceding element

- •


Dataset Representativeness Constraints Our current evaluation relies primarily on the MHJ dataset, which, while comprehensive, cannot capture the full spectrum of emerging adversarial techniques.

Report issue for preceding element

- •


Scalability Challenges: Although TCA operates as a supervisory system that only interjects when necessary, it still requires continuous background monitoring and analysis of all conversation turns. While this selective intervention approach minimizes disruption to legitimate conversations, the system must still perform semantic analysis on every interaction to determine risk levels. In our implementation, this background processing adds an average computational overhead of 120-150ms per turn. For high-volume deployments handling millions of simultaneous conversations, this ”always-on” monitoring creates resource demands, even though actual interventions (warnings or blocks) may occur in only 2-5% of exchanges. Optimizing this balance between comprehensive monitoring and resource efficiency remains challenging, particularly for resource-constrained deployments.

Report issue for preceding element

- •


Explainability vs. Security Trade-offs: While our system provides decision rationales, there exists an inherent tension between transparency and security. Detailed explanations of why certain conversations are flagged could potentially help adversaries refine their attack strategies. Conversely, limited explainability could undermine user trust and system accountability. Finding the optimal balance remains an open challenge.

Report issue for preceding element

- •


Extensibility and Adaptation to Evolving Threats: The TCA framework features a modular architecture designed for extensibility, allowing new pattern detectors and risk evaluation mechanisms to be integrated without system overhaul. This provides inherent adaptability to emerging threats. However, this extensibility introduces challenges in pattern selection, weight calibration, and ensuring backward compatibility. While implementing new detection components is relatively quick (1-3 days), proper calibration across diverse conversational contexts requires substantial time (2-4 weeks). Thus, despite the framework’s structural extensibility, maintaining effectiveness against evolving attack vectors demands ongoing investment.

Report issue for preceding element

- •


Cross-cultural and Multilingual Robustness: Our current implementation is not tested across different languages and cultural contexts. Security decision accuracy could be impacted when evaluated on non-English conversations, highlighting challenges in applying consistent risk assessment across diverse linguistic and cultural norms.

Report issue for preceding element

- •


Ethical Boundaries of Intervention: Determining appropriate intervention thresholds remains challenging, particularly for edge cases where security concerns must be balanced against legitimate user needs. For instance, conversations about cybersecurity education or academic research on adversarial techniques could trigger false positives.

Adaptive Weight Learning: Implementing machine learning techniques to dynamically adjust weights and thresholds based on system feedback and real-world data. This approach would reduce the need for manual calibration while enabling the system to adapt to domain-specific conversation patterns and evolving attack vectors through reinforcement learning mechanisms.

Broader Dataset Inclusion: A critical direction for future work is the comprehensive evaluation of the TCA framework across a wider variety of multi-turn adversarial datasets. While our current evaluation using the MHJ dataset provides valuable initial insights, expanding to some additional datasets would significantly strengthen validation claims and ensure broader generalizability.
