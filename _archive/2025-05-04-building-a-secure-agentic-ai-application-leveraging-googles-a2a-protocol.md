###### Abstract

Report issue for preceding element

As Agentic AI systems evolve from basic workflows to complex multi-agent collaboration, robust protocols such as Google’s Agent2Agent (A2A) become essential enablers. To foster secure adoption and ensure the reliability of these complex interactions, understanding the secure implementation of A2A is essential. This paper addresses this goal by providing a comprehensive security analysis centered on the A2A protocol. We examine its fundamental elements and operational dynamics, situating it within the framework of agent communication development. Utilizing the MAESTRO framework, specifically designed for AI risks, we apply proactive threat modeling to assess potential security issues in A2A deployments, focusing on aspects such as Agent Card management, task execution integrity, and authentication methodologies.

Report issue for preceding element

Based on these insights, we recommend practical secure development methodologies and architectural best practices designed to build resilient and effective A2A systems. Our analysis also explores how the synergy between A2A and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) can further enhance secure interoperability. This paper equips developers and architects with the knowledge and practical guidance needed to confidently leverage the A2A protocol for building robust and secure next-generation agentic applications.

## I Introduction

Report issue for preceding element

The emergence of intelligent, autonomous agents marks a pivotal shift in how AI systems are developed, deployed, and scaled. As these agents increasingly interact across organizational and technological boundaries, the need for secure, interoperable communication becomes critical. This paper begins by exploring the foundation of this transformation: the rise of Agentic AI and the protocols that enable it.

### I-AThe Rise of Agentic AI and the Need for Secure Interoperability

Report issue for preceding element

As artificial intelligence systems evolve from isolated, task-specific models to dynamic, multi-agent ecosystems, we are witnessing the emergence of Agentic AI—intelligent agents capable of autonomous decision-making, tool use, and collaboration with other agents and humans. These agents do not merely respond to prompts; they initiate actions, delegate subtasks, coordinate with peers, and adapt to new goals in real time. From AI research assistants that plan literature reviews to supply chain agents negotiating logistics across organizations, agentic AI is rapidly becoming the backbone of next-generation intelligent applications.
However, as these agents interact and compose workflows across organizational, geographical, and trust boundaries, the need for secure, standardized interoperability becomes paramount. Without a shared protocol for identity, authentication, task exchange, and auditability, agent interactions are prone to fragmentation, redundancy, and most critically—security vulnerabilities. Threats such as impersonation, data exfiltration, task tampering, and unauthorized privilege escalation can quickly arise in loosely governed agent ecosystems.
To address this, secure interoperability protocols like Google’s Agent-to-Agent (A2A) specification offer a promising foundation. A2A provides a declarative, identity-aware framework for enabling structured, secure communication between agents—whether human-authored or AI-powered.
Such protocols enable agents to share descriptive information about their capabilities, which is essential for facilitating effective interaction, discovery, and interoperability. This exchanged information, especially when received from potentially untrusted peers, must be handled with care and rigorously validated to prevent manipulation techniques like prompt injections.
Realizing the full potential of agentic AI will depend not only on such protocol standards, but on robust implementations, rigorous threat modeling, and continuous security adaptation. To aid developers in building secure systems, we also offer a repository containing secure A2A coding examples 111 [https://github.com/kenhuangus/a2a-secure-coding-examples](https://github.com/kenhuangus/a2a-secure-coding-examples "").

### I-BGoogle A2A: A Foundational Protocol and its Context

Report issue for preceding element

The Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol, introduced by Google, represents a significant step forward in enabling structured, secure, and interoperable communication between autonomous agents. Designed with composability and trust in mind, A2A allows agents to discover each other via standardized AgentCards, authenticate using modern cryptographic protocols, and exchange tasks in a declarative, auditable manner. Its architecture reflects the growing demand for modular AI systems that can scale across organizations, tools, and domains—while remaining adaptable to both human and machine-driven workflows. A2A’s emergence is timely, as the AI ecosystem increasingly shifts toward open-ended, agent-driven applications in areas like research, enterprise automation, cybersecurity, and scientific collaboration. Positioned at the intersection of protocol engineering and AI orchestration, A2A provides the plumbing needed to build reliable, multi-agent ecosystems—where interoperability and security are not afterthoughts, but built-in foundations.

### I-CPaper Objectives: Analyzing A2A, Proposing Enhancements, and Guiding Secure Implementation

Report issue for preceding element

This paper sets out to examine the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol in both its theoretical design and practical deployment, with the overarching goal of enabling secure and trustworthy agentic AI systems. First, we analyze the A2A protocol through the lens of the MAESTRO threat modeling framework, identifying a comprehensive set of risks that emerge in multi-agent environments—including spoofing, task replay, privilege escalation, and prompt injection. Building on this analysis, we propose targeted security enhancements to strengthen the protocol and its implementations, ranging from cryptographic controls and schema enforcement to secure session handling and fine-grained authorization. Finally, the paper outlines a set of implementation best practices for building hardened A2A servers and clients, offering guidance on secure communication, authentication workflows, logging, and abuse prevention. By bridging the gap between protocol specification and real-world deployment, this paper aims to equip developers, researchers, and architects with actionable insights for designing secure-by-default agentic ecosystems.

### II-AAgent to Agent Communication Literature Review

Report issue for preceding element

Agent-to-agent communication is fundamental to multi-agent systems (MAS), enabling autonomous entities to coordinate and collaborate to solve complex problems \[ [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.16902v1#bib.bib3 "")\]. Efficient and secure communication protocols are critical for sophisticated agent interactions across heterogeneous platforms. This review synthesizes the historical development, protocols, theoretical foundations, applications, challenges, and future directions of agent communication, with a focus on secure A2A multi-agent systems.

Report issue for preceding element

Early agent communication languages (ACLs) emerged from the Knowledge Sharing Effort (KSE) in the early 1990s \[ [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.16902v1#bib.bib4 "")\]. KQML, the pioneering ACL, defined a multi-layered architecture including content, message, and communication layers using speech act theory through performatives to specify message intentions \[ [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.16902v1#bib.bib3 "")\]. Building upon KQML, the FIPA ACL sought more rigor with a semantic framework based on modal logic, feasibility preconditions, and rational effects \[ [5](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.16902v1#bib.bib5 ""), [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.16902v1#bib.bib6 "")\]. These ACLs are based on speech act theory, formal semantics, and the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) model \[ [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.16902v1#bib.bib7 "")\].

Report issue for preceding element

Key protocols include KQML with its LISP-like syntax, and FIPA ACL which refines message structure and semantics with defined preconditions and outcomes \[ [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.16902v1#bib.bib3 "")\]. Protocols define interaction sequences between agents, including request, query, contract net, auction, and subscription \[ [5](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.16902v1#bib.bib5 "")\]. Recent efforts like Google’s A2A protocol aim to enable seamless interoperability between AI agents across different frameworks by standardizing task negotiation, capability sharing, and secure communication \[ [8](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.16902v1#bib.bib8 "")\].

Report issue for preceding element

Communication architectures in MAS can be direct (full, partial, or dynamic networks) or mediated (facilitator-based, blackboard systems, or global control) \[ [9](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.16902v1#bib.bib9 "")\]. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) allows agents to learn when, how, and what to communicate using differentiable, reinforcement, supervised, or regularized communication learning methods \[ [10](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.16902v1#bib.bib10 "")\].

Report issue for preceding element

Applications of agent communication range across enterprise knowledge management, customer service, supply chain management, healthcare, smart grids, autonomous vehicles, e-commerce, and disaster response \[ [9](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.16902v1#bib.bib9 ""), [5](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.16902v1#bib.bib5 "")\]. Security, trust, and the potential manipulation of feedback loops present inherent challenges. Integration with existing standards, scaling communication for efficiency, and handling non-stationarity in learning processes are open research areas \[ [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.16902v1#bib.bib4 ""), [11](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.16902v1#bib.bib11 ""), [5](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.16902v1#bib.bib5 "")\].

Report issue for preceding element

Future research should focus on multimodal communication, structured communication networks, robust centralized components, interpretable emergent languages, and integration with LLMs. Initiatives like A2A and MCP are aiming for protocol convergence for standardized agent communication, although many questions regarding how this may emerge are still unanswered. Effective communication remains crucial for the success of agent systems. Security must be considered throughout their evolution.

### II-BTraditional PKI and Transport Security

Report issue for preceding element

Early implementations of secure agentic systems leveraged public key infrastructure (PKI), with each agent provisioned a certificate and private key signed by a trusted certificate authority. This approach, frequently combined with SSL/TLS at the transport layer, guaranteed encrypted channels for agent communication \[ [12](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.16902v1#bib.bib12 "")\]. While PKI solutions remain fundamental to securing multi-agent messages, they often required complex certificate management, especially as agent populations grew or changed dynamically. Agent platforms such as JADE (Java Agent DEvelopment Framework) attempted to simplify this via security extensions that integrated PKI-based authentication \[ [13](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.16902v1#bib.bib13 "")\].

Report issue for preceding element

### II-CSOAP, WS-Security, and Enterprise Service Buses

Report issue for preceding element

Prior to the widespread adoption of RESTful services, enterprise-grade agentic applications often employed SOAP as the foundational protocol. The WS-Security suite \[ [14](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.16902v1#bib.bib14 "")\] provided message-level encryption, signatures, and token-based authentication for agent-to-service or agent-to-agent interactions. These frameworks were robust but verbose; they were well-suited to closed enterprise environments yet burdensome for lightweight agentic systems or real-time AI workflows. Still, they established fundamental principles of end-to-end message confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation at a time when microservices and ephemeral containers were not standard practice.

### II-DOAuth 2.0, JSON Web Tokens (JWT), and Service Accounts

Report issue for preceding element

With the shift to cloud and user-centric web applications, OAuth 2.0 became the de facto framework for delegated authorization \[ [15](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.16902v1#bib.bib15 "")\]. However, OAuth 2.0’s flows primarily focus on interactive user login. This made it challenging for autonomous agents to securely obtain and renew tokens without user intervention. JSON Web Tokens (JWT) \[ [16](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.16902v1#bib.bib16 "")\] introduced a lightweight format for securely transmitting agent identity and privileges. Many practitioners adopted service accounts or “robot accounts” with static credentials to simulate user roles in an agent scenario, though this introduced key-rotation and secret-management complexities.

Report issue for preceding element

### II-EZero-Trust Architectures and BeyondCorp

Report issue for preceding element

As multi-agent systems expanded across hybrid cloud environments, Zero-Trust principles emphasized continuous validation of identity and authorization, even for internal requests \[ [17](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.16902v1#bib.bib17 "")\]. Solutions like Google’s BeyondCorp architecture applied these principles, requiring every agent or service to authenticate with strong, verifiable credentials irrespective of network location \[ [18](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.16902v1#bib.bib18 "")\]. This paved the way for “never trust, always verify” policies, which align closely with the needs of autonomous AI agents that may operate across heterogeneous network boundaries.

### II-FLimitations of Historical Approaches

Report issue for preceding element

The historical approaches to securing agentic AI systems shared several common limitations:

Report issue for preceding element

- •


Manual Credential Management: Significant manual effort was required to provision, rotate, and revoke agent credentials.

Report issue for preceding element

- •


Adapting User-Centric Models: Substantial work was needed to adapt inherently user-centric security workflows to machine-only environments.

Report issue for preceding element

- •


Fragmented Implementations: The lack of uniform standards or cloud-native support for fully autonomous agents resulted in inconsistent security implementations.

Report issue for preceding element

- •


Scaling Challenges: As agent populations grew, the operational complexity of maintaining secure communication increased exponentially.

Report issue for preceding element


These early innovations and their limitations highlighted the fundamental importance of establishing robust identity and trust mechanisms for distributed AI, while also underscoring the need for simpler, more automated credential exchange processes specifically designed for autonomous agent interactions.

## III Understanding Google’s A2A Protocol

Report issue for preceding element

### III-AProtocol Overview

Report issue for preceding element

The A2A protocol facilitates communication between two primary types of agents:

Report issue for preceding element

- •


Client Agent: Responsible for formulating and communicating tasks.

Report issue for preceding element

- •


Remote Agent: Responsible for acting on those tasks to provide information or take action.

Report issue for preceding element


Built on established web standards including HTTP, JSON-RPC, and Server-Sent Events (SSE), A2A prioritizes compatibility with existing systems while maintaining a security-first approach. Its design follows several key principles:

Report issue for preceding element

- •


Agentic-first: Agents operate independently and communicate explicitly to exchange information, without shared memory or tools by default.

Report issue for preceding element

- •


Standards-compliant: Utilization of widely adopted web technologies minimizes developer friction.

Report issue for preceding element

- •


Secure by default: Integrated authentication and authorization measures safeguard sensitive data and transactions.

Report issue for preceding element


### III-BCommunication Flow

Report issue for preceding element

The A2A protocol defines a structured communication flow between agents that consists of several stages:

Report issue for preceding element

1. 1.


Discovery: The client fetches the target agent’s Agent Card (from /.well-known/agent.json) via HTTPS to learn about its capabilities, endpoint, and authentication requirements.

Report issue for preceding element

2. 2.


Initiation: After authenticating using a method specified in the Agent Card, the client sends a JSON-RPC request over HTTPS to the server’s a2aEndpointUrl using one of two methods:

Report issue for preceding element

- •


tasks.send: Used for potentially synchronous tasks or initiating tasks where immediate streaming isn’t required.

Report issue for preceding element

- •


tasks.sendSubscribe: Used for long-running tasks requiring streaming updates, establishing a persistent HTTPS connection for Server-Sent Events (SSE).

Report issue for preceding element


3. 3.


Processing & Interaction:

Report issue for preceding element

- •


Non-Streaming (tasks.send): The server processes the task and returns the final Task object in the HTTP response.

Report issue for preceding element

- •


Streaming (tasks.sendSubscribe): The server sends SSE messages over the persistent connection, including TaskStatusUpdateEvent (containing the updated Task object) and TaskArtifactUpdateEvent (containing generated Artifact objects).

Report issue for preceding element


4. 4.


Input Required: If additional input is needed, the server signals this via the response or an SSE event, and the client sends subsequent input using the same taskId.

Report issue for preceding element

5. 5.


Completion: The task transitions to a terminal state (completed, failed, or canceled), communicated via the final response or an SSE event.

Report issue for preceding element

6. 6.


Push Notifications (Optional): Servers supporting the pushNotifications capability can send asynchronous updates to a client-provided webhook URL, registered using tasks.pushNotification.set.

### III-CDiscoverability Mechanism

Report issue for preceding element

A central innovation of the A2A protocol is its robust discoverability mechanism, which enables agents to efficiently locate and leverage each other’s capabilities.

Report issue for preceding element

#### III-C1 AgentCard Structure

Report issue for preceding element

The AgentCard serves as the foundation of the A2A protocol’s discoverability mechanism. This structured JSON metadata file, located at the standardized path /.well-known/agent.json, functions as a machine-readable ”business card” describing an agent’s capabilities and interfaces. The AgentCard contains:

Report issue for preceding element

- •


Basic agent identification (name, version, provider).

Report issue for preceding element

- •


HTTPS endpoint URL for A2A communication (a2aEndpointUrl).

Report issue for preceding element

- •


Detailed function catalogs with parameter schemas.

Report issue for preceding element

- •


Required authentication methods using OpenAPI 3.x Security Scheme objects (e.g., apiKey, http bearer, oauth2, openIdConnect).

Report issue for preceding element

- •


Capability descriptions that define available functions.

Report issue for preceding element

- •


Hosted/DNS information detailing accessibility.

Report issue for preceding element


This standardized location creates a predictable discovery pattern across the entire A2A ecosystem, similar to how robots.txt and sitemap.xml function for web crawlers. The AgentCard’s JSON structure ensures both human readability and machine parsability, facilitating seamless integration between disparate agent systems.

Report issue for preceding element

### III-DCore Concepts

Report issue for preceding element

The A2A protocol is built around several fundamental concepts that structure agent interactions:

Report issue for preceding element

#### III-D1 AgentCard

Report issue for preceding element

As described earlier, the Agent Card is a public JSON metadata file that acts as a machine-readable business card. The quality and accuracy of Agent Cards can vary, which directly impacts discovery reliability and security posture advertisement.

Report issue for preceding element

#### III-D2 A2A Server

Report issue for preceding element

An agent exposing an HTTPS endpoint that implements the A2A JSON-RPC methods. It receives requests, manages task execution, and sends responses/updates.

Report issue for preceding element

#### III-D3 A2A Client

Report issue for preceding element

An application or another agent that consumes A2A services by sending JSON-RPC requests to a server’s a2aEndpointUrl. Clients can dynamically add and remove servers after launch, offering flexibility in how capabilities are discovered and utilized during runtime.

Report issue for preceding element

#### III-D4 Task

Report issue for preceding element

The fundamental unit of work in the A2A protocol, identified by a unique taskId provided by the client. Tasks progress through a defined lifecycle represented by TaskStatus values:

Report issue for preceding element

- •


TASK\_STATUS\_SUBMITTED

Report issue for preceding element

- •


TASK\_STATUS\_WORKING

Report issue for preceding element

- •


TASK\_STATUS\_INPUT\_REQUIRED

Report issue for preceding element

- •


TASK\_STATUS\_COMPLETED

Report issue for preceding element

- •


TASK\_STATUS\_FAILED

Report issue for preceding element

- •


TASK\_STATUS\_CANCELED

Report issue for preceding element


The protocol supports both short-lived request/response style interactions and long-running asynchronous tasks, making it suitable for complex workflows that may extend over days or weeks.

Report issue for preceding element

#### III-D5 Message

Report issue for preceding element

Represents a turn in the communication dialogue, containing a role (”user” for client-originated, ”agent” for server-originated) and one or more Parts.

Report issue for preceding element

#### III-D6 Part

Report issue for preceding element

The basic unit of content within a Message or Artifact. Defined types include:

Report issue for preceding element

- •


TextPart: For unstructured plain text communication.

Report issue for preceding element

- •


FilePart: For transferring files, either via inline Base64 encoded bytesContent or a URI reference.

Report issue for preceding element

- •


DataPart: For structured JSON data, identified by a mimeType (e.g., application/json).

Report issue for preceding element


#### III-D7 Artifact

## IV Threat Modeling Google A2A based Agentic AI Apps with MAESTRO

Report issue for preceding element

This section will focus on typical agentic AI applications built using Google A2A Applications. We will use the MAESTRO threat modeling framework \[ [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.16902v1#bib.bib1 "")\] and the work documented in \[ [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.16902v1#bib.bib2 "")\] to build application-specific threats for Agentic AI applications built using the Google A2A protocol.

### IV-ARecap of MAESTRO Threat Modeling Methodology

Report issue for preceding element

Traditional threat modeling frameworks often fall short when applied to agentic AI systems. These systems can autonomously make decisions, interact with external tools, and learn over time – capabilities that introduce unique security risks. That’s why we’ll use the MAESTRO framework, a seven-layer threat modeling approach specifically designed for agentic AI. MAESTRO offers a more granular and proactive methodology uniquely suited for the complexities of agentic systems like those built using A2A.

MAESTRO Layers: 1 (Foundation Model), 2 (Data Operations)
An attacker embeds malicious instructions using prompt injection techniques within the fields of an AgentCard (e.g., AgentSkill id, name, descriptions, tags or examples). When another agent automatically ingests and processes this AgentCard data as part of its discovery or interaction flow, it may execute these hidden instructions.
This exploits the trust placed in AgentCard content (Data Operations) and the automated processing of this content using the foundation model during its planning. As a result, the agent’s goals being hijacked, sensitive data being revealed, or internal security protocols being bypassed, highlighting the need to treat AgentCard content as untrusted input requiring careful validation and sanitization.

## X MCP and A2A: A Synergy

Report issue for preceding element

The Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol and Model Context Protocol (MCP) represent complementary frameworks that together create a robust foundation for sophisticated agentic systems. Rather than competing standards, these protocols operate at different layers of the AI interaction stack, enabling both horizontal coordination between peer agents and vertical integration with specialized tools and data sources. Table [I](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.16902v1#S9.T1 "TABLE I ‣ IX-F Server Implementation Best Practices ‣ IX Implementing A2A Server Securely ‣ Building A Secure Agentic AI Application Leveraging Google’s A2A Protocol") presents a comparative analysis of these two critical protocols in Agentic AI.

When deployed together, these protocols create an efficient hierarchical workflow system. An agent initially receives a complex task from either a human user or another agent through A2A protocols. To successfully complete this assignment, the agent often needs specialized capabilities beyond its own scope. Using A2A’s discovery mechanism, it identifies and delegates specific subtasks to purpose-built agents with relevant expertise, such as Claim Agents or Rental Car Agents. These specialized agents then leverage MCP to connect with structured data sources, computational tools, or external systems required to fulfill their assigned responsibilities. The completed work flows back through the agent hierarchy via A2A’s structured task management framework, enabling seamless integration of results from multiple specialized systems into a cohesive solution delivered to the original requestor. Figure [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.16902v1#S9.F4 "Figure 4 ‣ IX-H Server Hardening ‣ IX Implementing A2A Server Securely ‣ Building A Secure Agentic AI Application Leveraging Google’s A2A Protocol") illustrates the steps in such a use case.

The flow between a Claim Agent and Rental Car Agent would utilize the A2A protocol for agent-to-agent coordination and task management, where the Claim Agent (acting as the Main A2A Client) would discover the Rental Car Agent’s capabilities through the well-known agent registry, authenticate, and delegate specific rental-related tasks with unique taskIds. Meanwhile, the MCP framework enables each specialized agent to extend its capabilities by connecting to external tools and databases - the Claim Agent might access policy databases while the Rental Car Agent connects to vehicle availability systems. These frameworks complement each other by allowing the Claim Agent to maintain high-level coordination of the insurance claim process (tracking status updates and compiling final results for the user) while the Rental Car Agent uses MCP to perform specialized functions like querying vehicle inventories and processing rental agreements, ultimately delivering an integrated solution where claim processing and rental car arrangements happen seamlessly within a unified workflow.

This architectural approach promotes several key design principles. It enables functional modularity, allowing organizations to develop specialized agents with deep domain expertise. It supports compositional flexibility, as different agent combinations can be assembled to address diverse problems. It maintains clear separation of concerns between peer-level agent coordination and tool-level resource access. Most importantly, it creates an extensible ecosystem where new capabilities can be added incrementally without redesigning the entire system.

The multi-protocol architecture introduces important security considerations at integration boundaries. Potential attack vectors may cross protocol boundaries—for example, an authentication vulnerability in the A2A layer could be exploited to gain unauthorized MCP access, while sensitive information exposed through inadequately protected MCP connections might enable subsequent A2A-based compromises. Therefore, robust security strategies must address not only each protocol individually but also the critical interfaces where they interconnect. This comprehensive approach ensures continuous protection throughout the entire agent workflow chain, with special attention to authentication token handling, task delegation permissions, and secure data transmission between the Claim Agent, Rental Car Agent, and their respective external systems. \[ [19](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.16902v1#bib.bib19 "")\]

## XI Conclusion

Report issue for preceding element

### XI-ARecap of A2A’s Role, Security Challenges, and Enhancement Potential

Report issue for preceding element

The Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol plays a foundational role in enabling secure, composable, and scalable multi-agent systems. By standardizing how agents discover, authenticate, and communicate with one another, A2A facilitates a new paradigm of autonomous collaboration—ranging from document co-authoring agents to federated analytics across distributed datasets. Its declarative nature and emphasis on explicit capabilities (via AgentCards) empower developers to build trust-aware, modular workflows that reflect real-world boundaries and roles.
However, with these capabilities come significant security challenges. The distributed and dynamic nature of multi-agent systems introduces threats. Furthermore, novel risks such as prompt injection into AgentCards and cross-agent escalation highlight the need for context-aware threat modeling—such as that provided by the MAESTRO framework.
To realize the full potential of A2A-based systems, security must be deeply integrated into both protocol design and server implementation. From strong cryptographic controls and zero-trust agent authentication to schema validation, logging integrity, and resilient streaming protocols, robust security controls are essential. As multi-agent ecosystems grow in complexity, future enhancements to A2A should emphasize adaptive trust, continuous policy enforcement, and secure-by-default configurations. By proactively addressing today’s threats and anticipating tomorrow’s, A2A can serve as a resilient backbone for intelligent, secure, and trustworthy agentic AI applications.

### XI-BFuture Directions for Secure Agent Collaboration

Report issue for preceding element

Looking ahead, the secure collaboration of autonomous agents hinges on continued progress in protocol standardization and the widespread adoption of security best practices. Initiatives like A2A and MCP are crucial, but their evolution must prioritize security considerations, potentially incorporating lessons from Zero Trust architectures adapted for agent-specific contexts. Future work should focus on developing standardized methods for expressing and enforcing complex authorization policies between agents, establishing robust mechanisms for agent identity verification and reputation management, and creating frameworks for secure multi-agent coordination, especially when crossing administrative or trust boundaries. Furthermore, addressing the security implications of integrating Large Language Models within agentic workflows and ensuring the resilience of agent communication against sophisticated attacks will be paramount for building trustworthy and reliable multi-agent systems. The development of comprehensive threat models, like MAESTRO \[ [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.16902v1#bib.bib1 "")\], and shared security implementation guidelines will be vital for guiding developers in building the next generation of secure agentic AI applications.
