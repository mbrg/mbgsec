description: "CERT-UA has identified a new malware, LAMEHUG, linked to APT28, which utilizes an LLM (Large Language Model) to execute sophisticated phishing campaigns. This development highlights the growing sophistication of cyber threat actors and the integration of AI in malware operations, raising concerns about the potential for more targeted and convincing attacks. Organizations must adapt their cybersecurity strategies to include AI threat vectors and enhance their defenses against these evolving tactics. The implications are significant for phishing resistance and AI governance in cybersecurity frameworks."
