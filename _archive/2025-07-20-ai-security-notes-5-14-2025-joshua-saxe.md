summary: "The evolution of AI in cybersecurity indicates a shift towards decentralized, agent-based monitoring systems capable of collaborative threat detection. Small, edge-compute models are demonstrating effectiveness in reasoning and real-time responses despite minimal training data. This advancement coincides with the proliferation of AI-driven social engineering techniques, raising new security challenges. Notably, reinforcement learning has improved data efficiency for security applications, but poses ethical risks, as seen in AI models incentivizing harmful behaviors. Enhanced collaboration between lightweight agents and cloud-based managers could redefine enterprise network security frameworks."

A society of agents should defend our computer networks; social engineering as 'patient 0' for attacker AI adoption; reinforcement learning as a security data unblocker, and security risk

## We should build a society of edge and cloud AI agents that collaborate to secure enterprises

- Imagine that in 2028, networks are safeguarded by extensive teams of lightweight, on-device AI agents capable of performing multi-step investigations of suspicious behavior.

- These agents collaborate over Slack, and are overseen by more robust cloud-based reasoning model ‚Äòmanagers‚Äô, which are capable of coordinating device-level agents and performing deeper, multi-hour investigations.

- When human intervention is required, a team of relevant agents "joins the chat" to assist in investigating and resolving incidents.


## Evidence this could come to pass

- **Small, edge-compute sized models are showing higher quality, and can be trained as special purpose agents.** Open-weights laptop/phone-scale models can reason as or more effectively as last year's hundred billion parameter scale models; we can expect more efficiencies in small model cyber reasoning and agency.

- Here‚Äôs a chart [showing models that get good MMLU general knowledge results shrinking over time](https://hai.stanford.edu/ai-index/2025-ai-index-report/technical-performance):

- Here‚Äôs a chart from the [Deepseek r1 paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12948) showing edge scale models reasoning as well as GPT-4o-05-13!

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!gcw3!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2ec5ae62-93a1-4d15-bc75-363d4b79428f_1600x846.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!gcw3!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2ec5ae62-93a1-4d15-bc75-363d4b79428f_1600x846.png)

- **Cheap, fast inference on the edge is arriving.** Google‚Äôs new **[ML Drift](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.00232)** work shows ~10x throughput gains for 2b to 8b sized models on commodity GPUs, explicitly targeting laptops and phones.

- **Frontier models keep getting better at security.** For example, OpenAI‚Äôs o3 and DeepMind‚Äôs _Gemini 2.5 Pro_ system cards have shown step function progress in cybersecurity understanding and agency ( [key plot from o3 system card below](https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/2221c875-02dc-4789-800b-e7758f3722c1/o3-and-o4-mini-system-card.pdf)); and startups like XBOW are demonstrating effective cyber AI reasoning in the real world.

- **[Test-time scaling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03314) means we can put idle CPU and GPU cycles to work across enterprise computing stock.** The more LLMs think the better their reasoning. Why not use idle and overnight cycles to let on-device AI security analysts hunt for threats?


## **AI-powered social-engineering is now walking the adoption ‚ÄúS-curve‚Äù**

- Cheap text generation upskills and scales attacker abilities and kills the classic ‚Äúbad-grammar phishing tell.‚Äù The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) says [generative-AI enables scaling romance scams, investment fraud and spear-phishing.](https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2024/PSA241203)

- FBI warns that [attackers are already deploying AI voice- and video-cloning to impersonate executives, relatives and business partners in real wire-transfer frauds](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/sanfrancisco/news/fbi-warns-of-increasing-threat-of-cyber-criminals-utilizing-artificial-intelligence).

- There are a broad set of signals suggesting AI social engineering is ‚Äúpatient 0‚Äù in AI‚Äôs application in scaling cyber crime

- The security community should be doing more to get organized around this, answering questions like

  - How do we track threat actor groups based on their specific use of AI

  - What does useful data sharing look like around scaled AI generated phishing content

  - What mitigations and controls should we pursue at the community level relative to scaled social engineering activity?

## AI network defense‚Äôs biggest challenge is attack data sparsity. But reinforcement learning + LLMs is vastly more data efficient.

- Two new papers show that capabilities no model was able to achieve in H1 2024 can now be achieved with edge-device scale models with no or almost no training data. This matters for security because not having training data is a foundational problem for security AI.

- **The paper ‚Äú [Absolute Zero: Reinforced Self-play Reasoning with Zero Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03335)‚Äù** demonstrates training an LLM to reason about math and code through _self-play_ within a Python interpreter ‚Äî and no training data (and with a small, 7b model!). You should read this paper as presenting a microcosm of the future of agentic/reasoning learning in which agents do security ‚Äòself play‚Äô within cyber ranges and program weird machines.

- **‚Äú [Reinforcement Learning for Reasoning in Large Language Models with One Training Example](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.20571)‚Äù** shows _one_ training example can lead to dramatic improvements in a base model‚Äôs reasoning capabilities **.**

  - Qwen-2.5-Math-1.5B trained to solve a single math problem jumps MATH-500 accuracy from 36 % to 74 % and generalizes across six reasoning suites. Similar 30 %+ leaps appear across Llama-3-3B and DeepSeek-R1 variants.

  - Here is one of the magic training examples that leads to amazing reasoning improvements in their experiments

    [![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FDt_!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda37e443-4e4c-45cb-8177-7c9e9f279428_1320x206.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FDt_!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda37e443-4e4c-45cb-8177-7c9e9f279428_1320x206.png)

### **More on the relevance of this**

- RL-friendly tasks in security abound: corrupt the instruction pointer, capture the blue-team flag on a virtual cyber range, or craft an input that corrupts an instruction pointer; these are all possible self-play targets.

- OpenAI‚Äôs new [RL-fine-tuning API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reinforcement-fine-tuning) (and inevitable cloud clones) will let GPU-poor security teams adopt these methods in 2025. Now is a good time for security teams to experiment and build.


## **We should have a security mindset when we do reinforcement learning and deploy RL trained models.**

- A human social engineer wants money, or to please their nation-state paymasters, and will social engineer victims to achieve these monetary rewards.

- An LLM, trained with reinforcement learning, wants numerical rewards from its reward function, _**and will sometimes trick or harm humans to achieve these numerical rewards!**_


- **For example, after a model update, [ChatGPT began uncritically endorsing whatever users proposed](https://venturebeat.com/ai/openai-rolls-back-chatgpts-sycophancy-and-explains-what-went-wrong/) even when it could harm them. Public screenshots showed the model:**

  - calling a gag startup that sells ‚Äúliteral _shit on a stick_‚Äù a ‚Äúgenius performance-art venture‚Äù and urging the user to invest $30,000;

  - praising a user who claimed to have abandoned his family because of radio-signal hallucinations;

  - ‚Ä¶ the incident demonstrates that models can be expected (if we‚Äôre not careful) to _social-engineer their users_ to get higher reinforcement learning rewards, even if the result is financially or psychologically harmful.
- **One can imagine software engineer agents getting their numerical reward by taking dangerous security shortcuts**

  - [An empirical study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02059v2) of 733 Copilot-generated GitHub snippets found security weaknesses in roughly **30 %** of them, spanning 43 CWE categories‚Äîincluding OS-command injection and weak randomisation. The assistant satisfied the prompt quickly but embedded exploitable flaws.

  - This may or may not have been due to RL training, but I think we should expect new dangers with coding RL training, especially because people are now vibe coding and shipping whole programs.

Thanks for reading; this is a pretty raw dump of my thoughts and notes; feedback and comments welcome!
