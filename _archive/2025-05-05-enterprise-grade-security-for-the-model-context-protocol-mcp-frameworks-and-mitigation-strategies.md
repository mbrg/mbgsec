###### Abstract

Report issue for preceding element

The Model Context Protocol (MCP), introduced by Anthropic, provides a standardized framework for artificial intelligence (AI) systems to interact with external data sources and tools in real-time. While MCP offers significant advantages for AI integration and capability extension, it introduces novel security challenges that demand rigorous analysis and mitigation. This paper builds upon foundational research into MCP architecture and preliminary security assessments to deliver enterprise-grade mitigation frameworks and detailed technical implementation strategies. Through systematic threat modeling and analysis of MCP implementations and analysis of potential attack vectors, including sophisticated threats like tool poisoning, we present actionable security patterns tailored for MCP implementers and adopters. The primary contribution of this research lies in translating theoretical security concerns into a practical, implementable framework with actionable controls, thereby providing essential guidance for the secure enterprise adoption and governance of integrated AI systems.

### I-ABackground: The Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Report issue for preceding element

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a major step forward in standardizing how AI models interact with the world around them—giving them the ability to use tools and access real-time data on the fly \[ [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.08623v1#bib.bib1 "")\]. Foundational research, like the work by Hou et al. \[ [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.08623v1#bib.bib2 "")\], has laid out the basic components, how MCP works, and some early security concerns. Building on that, our focus shifts to what it takes to secure MCP in real-world, enterprise-level deployments.

Report issue for preceding element

To understand the security implications of MCP, it is essential to understand its fundamental architecture, which comprises three key components:

Report issue for preceding element

- •


MCP Host: Refers to the AI application or environment in which AI-driven tasks are performed and that operates the MCP client. Examples include applications such as Claude Desktop, and AI-driven integrated development tools like Cursor for software development. The host integrates tools and data, enabling interaction with external services through the MCP client and server.

Report issue for preceding element

- •


MCP Client: Serves as an intermediary in the host environment, facilitating communication between the MCP host and MCP servers. It sends requests and seeks information about the available services of servers. Data communication with servers is conducted securely and reliably via the transport layer.

Report issue for preceding element

- •


MCP Server: Serves as a gateway that allows the MCP client to interact with external services and execute tasks. The MCP Server offers three essential functionalities:

Report issue for preceding element

- –


Tools: Allows the server to invoke external services and APIs to execute tasks on behalf of the AI model.

Report issue for preceding element

- –


Resources: Exposes structured or unstructured datasets (e.g., local files, databases, and cloud platforms) to the model. When a model needs specific data (e.g., customer logs for a recommendation system), the server retrieves and processes it.

Report issue for preceding element

- –


Prompts: Are reusable templates managed by the server to enhance model responses, maintain consistency, and simplify repeated actions.

Report issue for preceding element


As MCP moves from theory into production, strong and scalable security becomes critical. Standard API security practices remain important but are insufficient to address the unique risks associated with MCP’s dynamic, tool-based model. One example is ”tool poisoning”—a type of attack where maliciously crafted tool descriptions trick AI models into doing things they shouldn’t \[ [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.08623v1#bib.bib3 "")\]. Our goal in this paper is to go beyond identifying risks, offering actionable security strategies that enterprises can implement to safeguard their MCP systems.

### I-BThe Broader Context: MCP Security and AI Governance

Report issue for preceding element

Securing protocols like MCP isn’t just a technical issue—it’s closely tied to the bigger picture of AI governance and responsible AI use. As AI systems become more autonomous and start interacting directly with external tools and real-time data through things like MCP, making sure those interactions are secure becomes absolutely essential. If an MCP implementation is compromised, the consequences can be severe—ranging from data leaks and unauthorized AI actions to loss of user trust and real-world harm, particularly when AI interacts with physical systems such as those in industrial IoT (IIoT). As a result, securing MCP is essential to building trustworthy AI systems, especially in complex enterprise environments. This paper contributes to that goal by providing practical strategies to mitigate the unique security risks introduced when AI systems interact with external tools.

### II-AThreat Modeling Methodology for MCP

Report issue for preceding element

Building upon our general risk identification approach, we employ the MAESTRO framework \[ [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.08623v1#bib.bib6 "")\] for comprehensive threat modeling of AI systems as applied to MCP \[ [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.08623v1#bib.bib7 "")\]. This framework provides a systematic methodology by examining potential vulnerabilities across seven specific layers of an AI system’s architecture, allowing for a structured analysis of the MCP security landscape.

We propose a multi-layered security framework based on defense-in-depth and Zero Trust principles, tailored to the specific risks of MCP. (See Table [I](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.08623v1#S3.T1 "TABLE I ‣ III-C4 Security Requirements for Multi-MCP Server Deployments ‣ III-C Additional Security Measures for MCPS ‣ III Comprehensive MCP Security Framework ‣ Enterprise-Grade Security for the Model Context Protocol (MCP): Frameworks and Mitigation Strategies") for a summary of key threats and corresponding mitigation controls). The overall security framework (see Figure [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.08623v1#S3.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ III-B2 Just-in-Time (JIT) Access Provisioning ‣ III-B MCP Client-Side Mitigations ‣ III Comprehensive MCP Security Framework ‣ Enterprise-Grade Security for the Model Context Protocol (MCP): Frameworks and Mitigation Strategies")) provides a high-level overview of the security framework.

Report issue for preceding element


Rationale: Establishes strong, verifiable identity and authorization as the foundation for access decisions.

Report issue for preceding element

#### III-A6 Tool and Prompt Security Management

Report issue for preceding element

Tools in the MCP ecosystem are dynamic, potentially executable entities with complex interaction patterns, rather than static code repositories. This section explores comprehensive strategies for vetting, validating, and monitoring tools throughout their lifecycle, treating each tool as a potential vector for sophisticated attacks such as tool poisoning, data exfiltration, and unauthorized system access.

Report issue for preceding element

Robust Tool Vetting and Onboarding: Implement a stringent process for approving and onboarding new tools:

Report issue for preceding element

- •


Security Review Checkpoints: Mandate security reviews, including static analysis (SAST), dynamic analysis (DAST), dependency scanning (Software Composition Analysis - SCA), and potentially manual code review/pentesting for complex or high-risk tools.

Report issue for preceding element

Clear Documentation: Require comprehensive documentation detailing the tool’s purpose, required permissions, data handling practices, interaction patterns, and security considerations.

Report issue for preceding element

- •


Structured Approval Workflow: Establish a formal approval process involving security, data governance, privacy, legal, and business stakeholders.

Report issue for preceding element

Malicious Pattern Detection: Use pattern matching (Regular Expressions - RegEx, YARA rules) and semantic analysis to detect known malicious instruction patterns, command injection attempts, or data exfiltration syntax within descriptions.

Report issue for preceding element

### III-BMCP Client-Side Mitigations

Report issue for preceding element

#### III-B1 Zero-Trust Security Model Implementation

Report issue for preceding element

The Zero Trust security model represents a paradigm shift from traditional perimeter-based security architectures. Rather than assuming trust based on network location, Zero Trust operates on the fundamental principle of ”never trust, always verify.” In the context of the Model Context Protocol, this approach becomes particularly critical due to the protocol’s inherently dynamic and potentially unpredictable interaction model. The traditional notion of a trusted internal network becomes obsolete when dealing with AI systems that can interact with a vast, constantly changing ecosystem of tools and data sources. Zero Trust provides a comprehensive framework for continuously validating every access attempt, ensuring that each interaction is scrutinized regardless of its origin or apparent legitimacy. Assume no implicit trust; continuously verify every access attempt.

Report issue for preceding element

#### III-B2 Just-in-Time (JIT) Access Provisioning

Report issue for preceding element

Just-in-Time (JIT) access provisioning challenges traditional resource access management by eliminating standing privileges. In the MCP ecosystem, where tools and resources can be dynamically invoked and may require temporary, highly specific access, JIT becomes a critical security mechanism. This approach minimizes the attack surface by dramatically reducing the window of potential unauthorized access.

Report issue for preceding element

- •


Dynamic, Time-Limited Access: Issue temporary access grants or credentials only for the duration required to complete a specific task or session.

Report issue for preceding element

- •


Context-Aware Access Decisions: Base access decisions not only on identity but also on context like device posture, location, time-of-day, and behavioral analytics.

Report issue for preceding element

- •


Purpose-Driven Authorization: Align requested permissions with the declared purpose of the tool invocation.

Report issue for preceding element

- •


Real-Time Revocation: Implement mechanisms for immediate revocation of access if risk factors change or suspicious activity is detected.

Report issue for preceding element

- •


For multi-step or multi-tool access, grant access to each tool only when necessary.

Report issue for preceding element


Rationale: Drastically reduces the window of opportunity for attackers by minimizing persistent access.

#### III-B3 Continuous Validation and Monitoring

Report issue for preceding element

Continuous validation departs from traditional authentication models that rely on a single, static authentication event. In the complex and dynamic world of MCP interactions, security cannot be a one-time checkpoint but must be an ongoing, real-time process. Continuously reassess trust throughout interactions by:

Report issue for preceding element

- •


Per-Request Authorization: Re-validate authorization for every MCP request, not just at the beginning of a session.

Report issue for preceding element

- •


Behavioral Anomaly Detection: Apply User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) to MCP interactions, identifying deviations from established normal patterns for users and tools.

Report issue for preceding element

- •


Risk-Based Authentication Step-Up: Trigger requirements for additional authentication factors if the assessed risk level increases during a session (e.g., sensitive tool invocation, anomalous behavior).

Report issue for preceding element

Session Monitoring and Reassessment: Continuously monitor session activity and periodically reassess trust based on changing context or risk signals.

Report issue for preceding element


Rationale: Ensures security posture adapts dynamically to changing conditions and potential threats emerging mid-session.

#### III-B4 Cryptographic Verification of Tool Sources and Integrity

Report issue for preceding element

Ensure tools are authentic and unmodified:

Report issue for preceding element

- •


Mandatory Code Signing: Require all integrated tools (especially binaries or executables) to be cryptographically signed by trusted entities (internal Certificate Authority (CA) or reputable third parties). Verify signatures before execution.

Report issue for preceding element

Simply adopting standard API security practices is insufficient. This paper has presented a comprehensive, multi-layered security framework specifically tailored for MCP, emphasizing defense-in-depth, Zero Trust principles, rigorous tool vetting, continuous monitoring, and robust input/output validation.

Report issue for preceding element

We provided detailed implementation strategies, operational guidelines, and reference patterns designed to be actionable for security practitioners building or managing MCP deployments in enterprise environments. The framework aids prioritization through its structure and the inclusion of qualitative risk assessments (Table [I](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.08623v1#S3.T1 "TABLE I ‣ III-C4 Security Requirements for Multi-MCP Server Deployments ‣ III-C Additional Security Measures for MCPS ‣ III Comprehensive MCP Security Framework ‣ Enterprise-Grade Security for the Model Context Protocol (MCP): Frameworks and Mitigation Strategies")). While the threat landscape will continue to evolve, and implementation presents challenges (Section V), implementing the framework described herein—integrating network, application, host, data, and identity controls—provides a strong foundation for securely leveraging MCP.
