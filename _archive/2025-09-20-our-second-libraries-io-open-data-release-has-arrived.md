## Don't miss the latest from Tidelift

Today weâ€™re publishing another Libraries.io open data release with over 311 million rows of metadata about open source projects and the network of dependency data that connects them all.

Six months ago we [published our first open data](https://web.archive.org/web/20241007111148/https://medium.com/@BenJam/libraries-io-releases-data-on-over-25m-software-repositories-ab1db665826e) as part of our commitment to the [Alfred P. Sloan and Ford Foundations](https://web.archive.org/web/20241007111148/https://medium.com/libraries-io/libraries-io-joins-brave-new-software-c8cb7bba93bf). The data supports [academics looking into trends in software development](https://web.archive.org/web/20241007111148/https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.04936), investors to understand the success of projects they support, and [developers to understand how their software is used](https://web.archive.org/web/20241007111148/https://libraries.io/rubygems/split/usage) more effectively than ever before.

Last week [we announced](https://web.archive.org/web/20241007111148/https://medium.com/libraries-io/why-libraries-io-and-dependency-ci-are-joining-tidelift-1caf72f4d1b0) that Libraries.io has joined forces with [Tidelift](https://web.archive.org/web/20241007111148/https://tidelift.com/) to make open source software work better for developers and users. Libraries.ioâ€™s mission hasnâ€™t changed and weâ€™re going to continue publishing open data releases every quarter to build a stronger, more informed open source ecosystem.

Since our last release the Libraries.io dataset has grown significantly, today weâ€™re releasing data on:

- 34 package managers

- 2.7 million projects

- 11 million versions

- 66 million project dependencies

- 31 million repositories

- 161 million repository dependencies

- 10 million manifest files

- 46 million git tags


The data is available in its raw format on [Zenodo](https://web.archive.org/web/20241007111148/https://zenodo.org/record/1068916) and weâ€™re working on getting it published as a structured, queryable dataset on Googleâ€™s BigQuery. If youâ€™d like to build tools on top of the most recent data, or top up your dataset to keep it current, check out the [Libraries.io REST API](https://web.archive.org/web/20241007111148/https://libraries.io/api).
