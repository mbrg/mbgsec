###### Abstract

Report issue for preceding element

We introduce AIRTBench, an AI red teaming benchmark for evaluating language models’ ability to autonomously discover and exploit Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) security vulnerabilities. The benchmark consists of 70 realistic black-box capture-the-flag (CTF) challenges from the Crucible challenge environment on the Dreadnode platform, requiring models to write python code to interact with and compromise AI systems. Claude-3.7-Sonnet emerged as the clear leader, solving 43 challenges (61% of the total suite, 46.9% overall success rate), with Gemini-2.5-Pro following at 39 challenges (56%, 34.3% overall), GPT-4.5-Preview at 34 challenges (49%, 36.9% overall), and DeepSeek R1 at 29 challenges (41%, 26.9% overall). Our evaluations show frontier models excel at prompt injection attacks (averaging 49% success rates) but struggle with system exploitation and model inversion challenges (below 26%, even for the best performers). Frontier models are far outpacing open-source alternatives, with the best truly open-source model (Llama-4-17B) solving 7 challenges (10%, 1.0% overall), though demonstrating specialized capabilities on certain hard challenges. Compared to human security researchers, large language models (LLMs) solve challenges with remarkable efficiency—completing in minutes what typically takes humans hours or days—with efficiency advantages of over 5,000× on hard challenges. Our contribution fills a critical gap in the evaluation landscape, providing the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to measure and track progress in autonomous AI red teaming capabilities.

## 1 Introduction

Report issue for preceding element

The rapid advancement of LLMs has sparked significant interest in their potential applications across cybersecurity domains. LLMs have advanced beyond text tasks and are now evaluated as agents, tested on their ability to use tools, navigate environments, and complete complex, long-horizon objectives. Cybersecurity researchers have also begun measuring the capabilities of such agents in static code analysis\[ [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.14682v1#bib.bib1 "")\], vulnerability detection\[ [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.14682v1#bib.bib2 "")\], traditional CTF challenges\[ [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.14682v1#bib.bib3 "")\], web-application pentesting\[ [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.14682v1#bib.bib4 "")\], and reverse engineering\[ [5](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.14682v1#bib.bib5 "")\]. However, agent effectiveness in performing AI red teaming remains a niche topic. This is problematic given the rapid deployment of language models—both in commercial products and by threat actors sharpening their offensive tools. This will almost certainly result in models attacking other models, in both ethical testing and malicious contexts.

To assess model performance in adversarial settings, this paper introduces AIRTBench—a framework for evaluating LLMs through AI/ML capture-the-flag challenges that simulate real-world threats. It provides a strong benchmark for measuring the progression of model capabilities, much like established benchmarks in software development\[ [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.14682v1#bib.bib6 "")\].

We contend that as we transition to a world where LLMs are used in critical applications, it’s essential to scale up our ability to interrogate their potential security vulnerabilities.

### 1.1 Contributions

Report issue for preceding element

This research has direct implications across the cybersecurity ecosystem, serving multiple stakeholders simultaneously. Security Operations Center (SOC) teams gain concrete examples of AI system compromises, enabling more effective monitoring and detection strategies for emerging LLM-specific threats. For red teams and penetration testers, our findings provide techniques to simulate realistic attacks against AI systems, helping organizations proactively identify vulnerabilities before malicious exploitation. AI/ML security engineers building and securing LLM applications can leverage our evaluation framework to test systems against common attack vectors and implement targeted safeguards. Additionally, vulnerability management teams benefit from our categorization of challenges according to industry standards like MITRE ATLAS\[ [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.14682v1#bib.bib7 "")\] and OWASP\[ [8](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.14682v1#bib.bib8 "")\], providing actionable intelligence for prioritizing security efforts in an increasingly AI-dependent landscape.

Report issue for preceding element

By bridging the gap between academic research and operational security, AIRTBench not only offers a measurement of model capabilities, but also a practical framework for organizations deploying AI systems in production environments.

### 1.2 Artifact Availability and Reproducibility

Report issue for preceding element

We open-sourced our evaluation tools and data to support community-driven development and position AIRTBench as a standard for red teaming LLMs. Our benchmark code is available on GitHub at [https://github.com/dreadnode/AIRTBench-Code](https://github.com/dreadnode/AIRTBench-Code ""), (details in Appendix [I](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.14682v1#A9 "Appendix I Running AIRTBench using our open github repository ‣ AIRTBench: Measuring Autonomous AI Red Teaming Capabilities in Language Models")) alongside our dataset for further research use (details in Appendix [J](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.14682v1#A10 "Appendix J Dataset contributions to open-source ‣ AIRTBench: Measuring Autonomous AI Red Teaming Capabilities in Language Models")). Through these contributions, we aim to foster a collaborative ecosystem for advancing AI red teaming capabilities and security benchmarking.

## 2 Background

Report issue for preceding element

Agentic Benchmarks The purpose of benchmarks is to measure the capabilities of models. As test set performance of the loss function has drifted from the performance of language models in tasks researchers and engineers care about, evaluations or ‘evals’ have emerged as a series of domain specific questions or tasks designed to track with performance as models become more capable. As standard evaluations like Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU)\[ [9](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.14682v1#bib.bib9 "")\] and Grade School Math 8K (GSM8K)\[ [10](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.14682v1#bib.bib10 "")\] have been saturated, with frontier models now scoring well above 80% on MMLU\[ [11](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.14682v1#bib.bib11 ""), [12](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.14682v1#bib.bib12 "")\] and above 90% on GSM8K\[ [13](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.14682v1#bib.bib13 ""), [14](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.14682v1#bib.bib14 "")\], traditional static benchmarks can no longer achieve their goal of smoothly charting model capabilities through generations. To overcome this, research and engineering efforts have now shifted into creating benchmarks that test the real-world capabilities of models. For example, SWE-Bench\[ [15](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.14682v1#bib.bib15 "")\] and its Verified extension: (SWE-Bench Verified)\[ [16](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.14682v1#bib.bib16 "")\] ground LLM evaluation in authentic software engineering workflows by drawing on GitHub-sourced vulnerability reports and framing each task as a realistic patch-generation challenge, thereby ensuring that model performance reflects practical code-repair and security-fixing scenarios rather than synthetic toy examples. Meanwhile, benchmarks like OSWorld\[ [17](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.14682v1#bib.bib17 "")\] test the capabilities of models to complete open-ended tasks in a real operating system. Still, others focus on agents designed to navigate a browser for web browsing tasks, or to complete tasks in a simulated environment\[ [18](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.14682v1#bib.bib18 ""), [19](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.14682v1#bib.bib19 ""), [20](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.14682v1#bib.bib20 "")\]. While more challenging to develop and run, these benchmarks are more representative of the real-world tasks that models will be used for and represent the latest battleground for model capabilities.

Report issue for preceding element

Code Generation Benchmarks Are as attractive as an agentic benchmark. Evolving from HumanEval\[ [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.14682v1#bib.bib6 "")\], modern code generation benchmarks are designed to test the capabilities of models in solving complete tasks in a realistic software engineering context. The tasks on these benchmarks are also mechanistically verifiable, running the unit and system tests of the task against the model’s generated difference to ensure the generated code is correct. This provides a precise approach to evaluate the correctness of the task and creates a robust proxy measure of model performance on software engineering. The ability to verify the correctness of the task cheaply and at scale is a key reason for the success of these benchmarks, allowing the benchmark to report a simple accuracy metric on a complicated open-ended task.

Report issue for preceding element

Harnesses for Agentic Benchmarks When evaluating the capabilities of these agents, we are no longer directly testing the models. Instead, the measure of performance is a combination of the model’s ability to complete the task, and that agent’s harness—the code surrounding the model, the tools it has access to, and the representation of its provided environment. This allows improvements to be made either to the models directly, or the design and implementation of the harness, to drive improvements in performance of these agents and to provide a more realistic evaluation of their capabilities.

Report issue for preceding element

Choice of harness is a critical factor in the performance of these agents. Different harness implementations have been evaluated on SWE-Bench, with projects like OpenDevin and SWE-Agent\[ [21](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.14682v1#bib.bib21 "")\] varying in their approaches to tool use and context management. Workflow-based techniques such as Agentless\[ [22](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.14682v1#bib.bib22 "")\] take entirely different paths—often using the same models but with fundamentally distinct strategies.

Agentic Benchmarks for Security
This trend in more realistic benchmarks has also been gaining momentum in AI security. The NYU CTF Bench and Intercode-CTF benchmarks\[ [23](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.14682v1#bib.bib23 ""), [24](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.14682v1#bib.bib24 "")\] originated to test the capabilities of models to solve open-ended security tasks traditionally solved by humans. This benchmark has successfully advanced the state of the art in AI/ML security research, spurring the development of harnesses like EnIGMA\[ [25](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.14682v1#bib.bib25 "")\] to test the upper limits of model capabilities.

Agentic Benchmarks for AI Security In AutoAdvExBench\[ [26](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.14682v1#bib.bib26 "")\], the authors create a benchmark for testing the capabilities of models to autonomously bypass defenses against adversarial examples. That is, the agent is to create adversarial samples that can bypass the defense of those models. The authors break these challenges up between CTF-like difficulty and real-world difficulty, and they measure the performance of their agent on each set of challenges.

CTF Frameworks for AI Security CTF competitions are a popular way for security professionals to hone their skills and develop new competencies\[ [27](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.14682v1#bib.bib27 "")\] in a controlled environment. They range from abstract puzzles to highly realistic scenarios—such as launching attacks against live AI services or securing production-style pipelines—and test proficiencies in areas like reverse engineering, exploit development, cryptography, and obscure protocol analysis.

Report issue for preceding element

As AI security research has grown in prominence, so has interest in creating CTF environments to test human ability to probe models for vulnerabilities. These traditional CTF frameworks have been adapted to incorporate AI security challenges. Notable examples include AI CTF competitions\[ [28](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.14682v1#bib.bib28 "")\] that test model robustness, security, and adversarial resilience. These frameworks typically evaluate model vulnerabilities to prompt injection attacks, resistance adversarial examples, defenses against model extraction attempts, and the security of model deployment pipelines.

## 3 Benchmark

Report issue for preceding element

### 3.1 Benchmark Construction

Report issue for preceding element

AIRTBench is a benchmark featuring CTF-style challenges for evaluating key components of AI/ML security, and includes flags that enable mechanistic verification of submitted solutions.

Report issue for preceding element

Crucible is the proprietary challenge environment hosted on the Dreadnode platform that contains the AIRTBench challenges. These challenges vary in complexity and range from adversarial inputs to model inversion. Many of the challenges require chaining attack types together to get the flag, making them an interesting benchmark for evaluating model reasoning capabilities.

Report issue for preceding element

For AIRTBench, we test agents across 70 unique Crucible challenges—almost all of which are publicly available (categorized in Table LABEL:tab:challenges). We explicitly exclude two challenges from the complete Crucible challenge set: deeptweak and dyana. We removed the deeptweak challenge due to its purposefully large reasoning output which skews the input tokens for the attack model in AIRTBench. We removed the dyana challenge as it requires physical hardware access outside our containerized environment.

### 3.2 Task Formulation

Report issue for preceding element

Model Input. The model is given a natural language description of the challenge goal, along with starter code in a Jupyter notebook for interacting with the environment and submitting a flag. This is the same input that human participants receive when beginning a challenge on the Crucible platform.

Report issue for preceding element

Evaluation Metric The challenge is considered solved if the model can successfully submit the flag to the challenge, as verified by the Crucible API. The metric for AIRT (Artificial Intelligence Red Teaming) is the percentage of challenges for which the model can successfully submit the correct flag.

### 3.3 Features of AIRTBench

Report issue for preceding element

Traditional CTF benchmarks often rely on scraped challenges with uncertain solvability, whereas AIRTBench offers several methodological advantages through its battle-tested challenge design. The benchmark operates in realistic black-box scenarios where agents lack access to underlying system architecture, mirroring authentic adversarial conditions. By maintaining human-model parity—challenges designed for and verified by human participants—AIRTBench enables direct comparison between human and algorithmic problem-solving capabilities across a standardized baseline. The evaluation framework encompasses diverse security task types (for example, adversarial inputs, model inversion, system exploitation) within a common harness using code as the action space. Challenge design includes deliberate ambiguity and “trick” questions requiring non-literal reasoning and inference with uncertainty. Difficulty levels range systematically from entry-level concepts to advanced scenarios suitable for experienced security professionals, providing granular capability assessment. Furthermore, AIRTBench is inherently updatable through the continuous development of new challenges on the Crucible challenge environment hosted on the Dreadnode platform, allowing the benchmark to evolve alongside advancing model capabilities. Finally, challenges necessitate multi-step reasoning and strategy adaptation across long context lengths, evaluating the ability of agents to maintain the challenge state and respond appropriately to feedback—critical components of effective autonomous red teaming.

Each agent is granted access to an internet-connected Jupyter kernel via a custom docker image (detailed within Appendix [B](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.14682v1#A2 "Appendix B Environment Details ‣ AIRTBench: Measuring Autonomous AI Red Teaming Capabilities in Language Models")). Within the initial user prompt, the agent is presented with each challenge’s Jupyter notebook [challenge notebook architecture](https://docs.dreadnode.io/crucible/how-to/use-challenge-notebooks "") made available via the Crucible API as a technical artifact and also presented to human participants. The jupyter/datascience-notebook base Docker image\[ [29](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.14682v1#bib.bib29 "")\] was selected as providing a pre-configured Jupyter environment with essential data science libraries like NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Matplotlib. These packages enable rapid prototyping, AI/ML model analysis, adversarial attack testing, data forensics, and automation, making it a natural fit for solving AI/ML security CTF challenges.

Additionally, we augmented this foundation with specialized libraries for machine learning, computer vision, security testing, and web interaction to ensure agents have access to the necessary tools for tackling diverse security challenges. We do not claim that this harness is optimal for maximizing AIRTBench scores, but rather that it provides a strong baseline for future work.

Report issue for preceding element

The harness includes the use of Crucible API calls as a tool-calling function, which allow agents to interact with the platform’s standardized challenge endpoints, submitting requests to interact with challenges, and solutions to receive feedback on challenge completion as well as eventual flag submission. This integration enables seamless communication between the LLM agents and the Crucible platform, facilitating a smooth evaluation process. The Jupyter kernel access allows agents to execute code snippets, analyze data, and perform complex computations in real-time, enhancing their ability to solve security challenges effectively.

### 3.5 Challenges

Report issue for preceding element

Our evaluation framework encompasses a diverse set of 70 AI/ML security challenges hosted on the Crucible platform, aligned with the MITRE ATLAS and OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Model Applications frameworks. These challenges span the full spectrum of adversarial machine learning techniques and AI/ML security vectors, including prompt injection (20 challenges), data analysis (14), evasion across multiple modalities (12), model inversion (5), system exploitation (5), RAG-specific prompt injection (5), system prompt leakage (3), and others covering fingerprinting (2), model data tampering (2), model extraction (1), and data poisoning (1). Challenge complexity ranges from entry-level security concepts to sophisticated attack chains requiring deep technical knowledge and reasoning capabilities. Each challenge is implemented as an isolated FastAPI application with standardized endpoints, providing consistent experimental conditions while supporting implementation variability specific to each security task. A comprehensive breakdown of all challenges by type, difficulty level, and corresponding framework categorizations is provided in Appendix [A](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.14682v1#A1 "Appendix A Challenges ‣ AIRTBench: Measuring Autonomous AI Red Teaming Capabilities in Language Models").

This command initiates the evaluation process, allowing the agent to interact with the challenges defined in the AIRTBench suite. The parameters can be adjusted based on specific experimental needs, such as increasing the maximum steps or enabling caching for faster responses.

Report issue for preceding element

Our AIRTBench evaluation environment was run with the aforementioned parameters for each model, with a total of ten passes per challenge (with the exception of gpt-4.5-preview111The gpt-4.5-preview model was deprecated by OpenAI during our evaluation timeline, resulting in an incomplete dataset with a mean of 5.2 runs per challenge (median: 5.0, min: 3.0, max: 7.0) instead of the standard 10 runs. All metrics for this model should be interpreted with this limitation in mind.). Each pass consisted of 70 unique runs (one run per challenge). This setup enables us to collect comprehensive and statistically meaningful performance metrics across different models and challenge types. By executing 10 passes per challenge, we mitigate variance due to stochastic model behavior, enhance fault tolerance, and ensure fairness by affording each model equal opportunities to attempt every task under consistent conditions. Our evaluation framework enforces model persistence, requiring models to continue attempts until either a flag is successfully found or the maximum number of allowed steps (100) is reached.

### 5.1 Performance Analysis Key Highlights

Report issue for preceding element

Our experimental evaluation of AIRTBench across 70 AI/ML security challenges reveals significant patterns in model performance and capability boundaries. Table [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.14682v1#S5.T2 "Table 2 ‣ 5.1 Performance Analysis Key Highlights ‣ 5 Results ‣ AIRTBench: Measuring Autonomous AI Red Teaming Capabilities in Language Models") presents a comprehensive overview of model performance across all 70 challenges, showing both suite success rates (percentage of challenges solved) and overall success rates (percentage of successful runs across all attempts). The data confirms Claude-3.7-Sonnet’s dominance with a 61.4% suite success rate, solving 43 out of 70 challenges, followed by Gemini-2.5-Pro at 55.7% (39 challenges) and GPT-4.5 at 48.6% (34 challenges). Notably, the gap between suite success rates and overall success rates reveals the consistency challenges faced by even top-performing models—Claude-3.7-Sonnet’s overall success rate drops to 46.9%, indicating that even when a model can solve a challenge, it doesn’t succeed on every pass. These frontier models consistently outperformed their open-source counterparts, with Llama-3.3-70b solving no challenges and QWQ-32B models solving only a small subset of the easiest prompt injection challenges.

Most notably, success rates were highly dependent on challenge difficulty level( [6.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.14682v1#S6.SS2 "6.2 Challenge Difficulty Model Comparisons ‣ 6 Performance Analysis Summary ‣ AIRTBench: Measuring Autonomous AI Red Teaming Capabilities in Language Models")) and category( [6.3](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.14682v1#S6.SS3 "6.3 Challenge Category Model Comparisons ‣ 6 Performance Analysis Summary ‣ AIRTBench: Measuring Autonomous AI Red Teaming Capabilities in Language Models")). Prompt injection challenges saw the highest solve rates (averaging 49% across all models), while more complex categories like model inversion and system exploitation proved substantially more difficult (with solve rates of 11% and 7% respectively). Easy-difficulty challenges were solved at an average rate of 31.7%, medium-difficulty at 10.7%, and hard-difficulty challenges at only 1.8%, demonstrating a clear performance gradient that aligns with the challenge taxonomy.

### 5.2 Human Operator Versus Agent Performance Solve Times

Report issue for preceding element

Our analysis of solve times reveals striking disparities between human operators and AI agents across different challenge types, aligning with findings from recent work on automation advantages in red teaming \[ [31](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.14682v1#bib.bib31 "")\]. As shown in Table [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.14682v1#S5.T3 "Table 3 ‣ 5.2 Human Operator Versus Agent Performance Solve Times ‣ 5 Results ‣ AIRTBench: Measuring Autonomous AI Red Teaming Capabilities in Language Models"), AI agents consistently achieve solution times measured in minutes compared to human operators’ average solve times measured in hours—often demonstrating orders of magnitude improvements in efficiency. This pattern holds across challenges of varying difficulty levels, with agents solving problems in minutes that typically take human operators several hours or even days to complete.

Report issue for preceding element

The temporal metrics further illustrate the considerable variability in challenge complexity, with average human solution times ranging from under 1 hour (pieceofcake) to over 2,000 hours (brig1, brig2), highlighting the spectrum of difficulty incorporated into our benchmark. Notably, several of the most time-consuming challenges for humans, such as brig1 (2,439.9 hours) and brig2 (2,099.3 hours), remain entirely unsolved by all agent models. In contrast, the challenging turtle challenge (1,296.5 hours for humans) was solved by three frontier models at 10% success rates each, demonstrating that even extremely difficult challenges can sometimes yield to specialized AI capabilities. This creates a natural difficulty ceiling in our benchmark with clear boundaries between achievable and currently impossible tasks.

Interestingly, performance patterns vary significantly across model families. Frontier models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet and Gemini-2.5-Pro successfully solved several challenges that stumped other models entirely, with Claude-3.7-Sonnet uniquely solving challenges like cubic (80%) and miner (50%). Specialized capabilities emerged across different models where surprisingly, both probe and extractor share the same "system prompt leakage" category at an easy difficulty level, yet were each solved exclusively by different frontier models—DeepSeek-R1 for probe and Gemini-2.5-Pro for extractor (10%). Llama-4-17B demonstrated remarkable efficiency on turtle (solving in just 0.3 minutes). Challenges with high solve rates showed relatively consistent performance across model architectures—suggesting these represent more standardized attack patterns broadly captured in model training. Even on simpler challenges like bear4, which saw an 82% human solve rate but required 41.6 hours on average, model solve times ranged from 0.4 minutes (o3-mini) to 1.4 minutes (Gemini-2.5-Pro and GPT-4.5), highlighting performance variations even among frontier models on straightforward tasks.

Our analysis reveals notable disparities in solve times across difficulty levels. Both humans and AI showed similar success patterns, with the turtle challenge proving exceptionally difficult for humans (6% human success rate), while being solved by three frontier models with remarkable efficiency (8.9-18.4 minutes for Claude-3.7-Sonnet and Gemini-2.5-Pro, and just 0.3 minutes for Llama-4-17B). In contrast, puppeteer1 was broadly solvable for both groups (80% human, 85% AI success). The most significant finding is the extreme efficiency advantage of AI agents, solving in minutes what takes human operators days or weeks to accomplish, while maintaining comparable success rates on challenges across the difficulty spectrum.

### 6.1 Overall Run Distribution and Model Comparisons

Report issue for preceding element

In addition to the challenge-by-challenge performance, we analyzed the distribution of successful versus unsuccessful runs across all models. Our analysis provides a comprehensive view of how each model performed across different challenge categories, showing success rates as percentages along with the number of successful attempts out of total attempts (full details in Appendix [C](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.14682v1#A3 "Appendix C Model Success Rates ‣ AIRTBench: Measuring Autonomous AI Red Teaming Capabilities in Language Models")).

Report issue for preceding element

The success rate distribution reveals salient performance disparities, not only across models but also across challenge types. Looking at the detailed results in Table [11](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.14682v1#A3.T11 "Table 11 ‣ Appendix C Model Success Rates ‣ AIRTBench: Measuring Autonomous AI Red Teaming Capabilities in Language Models"), we observe that prompt injection challenges like bear1 through bear4, puppeteer1 and puppeteer2 show consistently high success rates across multiple models (70-100% for frontier models), demonstrating their relative susceptibility to automated exploitation. In contrast, more complex challenges like brig1, brig2, extractor2, and semantle2 remained unsolved by all models, revealing significant capability gaps even among state-of-the-art systems. Notably, Claude-3.7-Sonnet demonstrated remarkable breadth in its problem-solving capabilities, being the only model to solve certain complex challenges like cubic (80% success), miner (50% success), and cluster3 (40% success). The particularly difficult turtle challenge highlights an interesting capability exception, being solved by three models—Claude-3.7-Sonnet, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and notably Llama-4-17B (each at 10% success)—despite the latter showing limited performance across most other challenges. Interestingly, even among related challenge families, we observe provider-specific capabilities: in the prompt injection (system prompt leakage) category, DeepSeek-R1 was the only model to solve probe (10% success) while Gemini-2.5-Pro was the only model to solve extractor (10% success), suggesting that different approaches to similar vulnerability types may be uniquely successful across model architectures. The pattern of completely unsolved challenges (appearing as rows of gray cells in our full results matrix) further illustrates the current frontier of AI agent capabilities, with a clear demarcation between challenges that can be reliably solved by multiple models and those that remain beyond the reach of even the most advanced systems—particularly in the areas of model inversion, advanced prompt engineering, and multi-step exploitation sequences.

Table 4: AIRT Bench Success Rates by Model and Challenge DifficultyReport issue for preceding element

Analysis of challenge success rates by difficulty reveals stark capability differences across the model landscape. Claude-3.7-Sonnet demonstrates remarkable versatility, leading performance across all difficulty tiers (65.1% on easy, 31.7% on medium, and 14.0% on hard challenges)—notably being the only model to solve hard challenges at a substantial rate. The performance drop between difficulty tiers is consistent across all models, with success rates typically falling by 50-70% between adjacent difficulty levels. Among frontier models, GPT-4.5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro show competitive performance on easy and medium challenges (55.0% and 53.8% on easy challenges, respectively), but struggle significantly with hard challenges (2.0% and 3.0% success rates, respectively). The stark contrast between model capabilities becomes most evident at the hard challenge tier, where only six models (Claude-3.7-Sonnet with 14.0%, Gemini-2.5-Pro with 3.0%, GPT-4.5 with 2.0%, Gemini-2.0-Flash with 1.0%, Gemini-1.5-Pro with 1.0%, and Llama-4-17B with 1.0%) achieved any success, while six models failed completely. Notably, models from the Gemini family represent three of the five systems that solved any hard challenges, suggesting potential architectural advantages for complex reasoning tasks. This pattern suggests that truly difficult AI red teaming tasks remain beyond the capabilities of most contemporary models. While Llama-4-17B demonstrated an exceptional capability in solving the turtle challenge (a hard difficulty task), open-source models generally showed very limited success across the benchmark, with Llama-4-17B achieving only 1.4% success on easy challenges and 0.4% on medium challenges, while Llama-3.3-70B failed to solve any challenges across all difficulty tiers. The total aggregated success rates of 31.7% for easy, 10.7% for medium, and just 1.8% for hard challenges demonstrate how effectively our benchmark’s difficulty tiers discriminate between model capabilities, providing clear separation points for measuring progress in AI red teaming capabilities.

Analysis of model performance across different challenge categories reveals distinctive capability profiles among frontier models. Claude-3.7-Sonnet demonstrates exceptional versatility, leading in 10 out of 13 categories and showing particularly strong performance in model inversion (32.0%) and system exploitation (26.0%) categories—areas where most other models struggle significantly. Prompt injection challenges proved most tractable across all models, with Claude-3.7-Sonnet (62.0%) and Gemini-2.5-Pro (59.0%) achieving the highest success rates. The vast capability gap between frontier and open-source models becomes even more pronounced when examining specific challenge categories—particularly complex categories like model inversion, where no open-source model achieved any success.

Interestingly, niche capabilities emerge across different model families. For instance, Gemini-2.5-Pro was the only model to achieve any success (3.3%) in the challenging prompt injection (system prompt leakage) category with the extractor challenge, while DeepSeek-R1 was the only model to solve the probe challenge (3.3%) in the same category. Similarly, while Claude-3.7-Sonnet maintains the highest overall performance, GPT-4.5 shows competitive strength in data poisoning/evasion challenges (100%) and model extraction (100%), suggesting specialized capabilities in certain attack vectors. Most models showed complete failure (0% success) in model evasion (audio) challenges, highlighting a common capability gap across the AI ecosystem. Notably, Llama-4-17B achieved a 10% success rate in the data poisoning/evasion (data) category despite its otherwise limited performance (1.0% overall success rate), further demonstrating how specific security capabilities can emerge even in models with generally lower performance.

The most remarkable pattern across challenge categories is the consistent hierarchy of model performance, with Claude-3.7-Sonnet (46.9% overall) maintaining its lead across most categories, followed by GPT-4.5 (36.9%) and Gemini-2.5-Pro (34.3%). This consistency suggests that general reasoning capabilities transfer effectively across different security challenge types, rather than models having highly specialized capabilities in specific attack categories.

Our data reveals that conversation length serves as both a performance indicator and a characteristic model signature. Claude-3.7-Sonnet consistently required fewer conversation turns to solve easy and medium challenges compared to other models, averaging 5.2 turns for prompt injection tasks versus 7.8 turns for Gemini-2.5-Pro on identical challenges. This efficiency advantage diminishes on hard challenges, where Claude’s turn count rises substantially (12.4 turns on average), though still remaining marginally more efficient than competitors (13.9 turns for GPT-4.5 on equivalent challenges).

In terms of token efficiency, the data reveals stark contrasts between successful and unsuccessful solution attempts. On average, successful runs require only 8.6K tokens compared to 49.2K tokens for failed attempts—a nearly 6× difference in computational resource utilization. This efficiency gap is particularly pronounced for frontier models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet (15.1K tokens for successful solves versus 86.8K for failures) and Gemini-2.5-Pro (16.2K versus 121.1K tokens). Similarly, conversation lengths for successful attempts average just 19 turns compared to 186 turns for unsuccessful attempts, highlighting the critical difference between focused problem-solving and unproductive exploration.

Model families exhibit distinctive efficiency signatures when solving challenges. Claude-3.7-Sonnet demonstrates notable token efficiency on simpler challenges like puppeteer1 (1.6K tokens), squeeze1 (1.7K tokens), and puppeteer2 (1.6K tokens), but requires substantially more tokens for complex challenges like miner (67.2K tokens) and cubic (64.1K tokens). This pattern suggests a non-linear scaling of computational resources as challenge complexity increases.

Another notable pattern is the "exploration penalty" visible in models tackling unfamiliar problem spaces. Claude-3.7-Sonnet’s token usage on cluster3 (60.0K tokens) represents approximately a 30× increase over simple prompt injection tasks, reflecting extensive exploration of potential solution pathways. This suggests that pioneering approaches to previously unsolved challenges inherently requires greater computational investment and highlights the importance of effective reasoning strategies and suggests that models may benefit from improved stopping policies to abandon unpromising solution paths more quickly.

Token usage metrics directly translate to economic costs when using commercial model APIs, making these efficiency patterns practically relevant for real-world deployment. Our cost analysis (detailed in Appendix [G](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.14682v1#A7 "Appendix G Cost Analysis ‣ AIRTBench: Measuring Autonomous AI Red Teaming Capabilities in Language Models")) reveals striking differences in economic efficiency across models. While Claude-3.7-Sonnet achieves the highest success rate, its high token usage on complex challenges results in significantly higher costs per run ($6.70 average) compared to more token-efficient models like Gemini-2.0-Flash ($0.13 average).

Report issue for preceding element

Most notably, our analysis shows that successful runs are substantially more cost-effective than failed attempts, with successful runs typically costing $0.002-$6.06 compared to failed runs which range from $0.096 to $133.35. These economic considerations become increasingly important as red teaming exercises scale from isolated challenges to comprehensive security evaluations spanning hundreds or thousands of potential attack vectors.

### 6.5 Rate Limiting and Model Performance

Report issue for preceding element

An important dimension of our benchmark evaluation is the inclusion of rate limiting as a core environmental constraint when measuring model performance. Unlike many conventional benchmarks, our setup treats language models as autonomous AIRT agents—entities tasked with solving complex problems under conditions more akin to real-world operational deployments. In such settings, rate limits on API calls are a common challenge, particularly when interfacing with remote systems. Just as human operators must reason about limited querying budgets, backoff strategies, or partial observability, so too should large language models. By incorporating rate limiting into our evaluation, we not only test a model’s raw problem-solving ability but also its adaptive planning, prioritization, and efficiency under resource constraints. This allows for a more equitable and realistic comparison between human and machine agents, while also surfacing critical weaknesses in current LLMs when faced with bounded querying environments.

This analysis illustrates the frequency of rate limit errors across various models, highlighting the challenges faced by each in maintaining consistent performance under constrained conditions. This analysis reflects rate limiting coming from the Crucible challenge API to the attack agent, and is a significant factor in model performance, revealing how different models adapt to or struggle with these constraints.

The table summarizes the percentage of rate limit errors encountered over the total run distribution by each model, the average number of rate limit errors per challenge, and the total number of challenges attempted by each model.Report issue for preceding element

The data reveals significant variations in how models handle rate limiting constraints. Notably, Gemini-2.5 models (both Pro and Flash) experienced the highest rate limiting (38.1% and 36.7%, respectively) yet maintained strong performance, suggesting robust adaptation to constraints. Similarly, DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-4.5 performed well despite facing substantial rate limiting (31.9% and 33.3%). In contrast, Llama models experienced minimal rate limiting (2.14% for Llama-3.3-70b and 4.14% for Llama-4-17b), but showed lower overall performance, indicating their struggles may stem from reasoning capabilities rather than API constraints. Claude-3.7-Sonnet demonstrated remarkable resilience with the highest overall success rate (46.9%) despite encountering rate limiting in 16.4% of attempts. These patterns suggest that advanced models with sophisticated planning capabilities can maintain effectiveness even under significant operational constraints, an essential attribute for real-world red teaming applications.

### 6.6 Attack Agent Traces

Distinguished as one of the most complex challenges in the AIRTBench, the turtle challenge has demonstrated exceptional difficulty with only a 6% human operator solve rate. Notably, during its initial release at the [Singapore AI CTF (October 2024)](https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/events/singapore-ai-ctf-2024/ ""), only one human operator successfully solved this challenge, highlighting its position at the upper boundary of reasoning difficulty in our benchmark suite. Despite this high difficulty level, three frontier models—Claude-3.7-Sonnet, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Llama-4-17B—successfully solved this challenge, each employing distinctly different exploitation strategies.

The models exhibited remarkably different exploitation strategies: Claude-3.7-Sonnet employed a methodical multi-step approach requiring 30 conversation turns, exploring several prompt injection techniques before identifying a working exploit. Gemini-2.5-Pro demonstrated a more verbose but highly structured approach spanning 41 interaction steps, systematically testing various prompt formats until successfully crafting a precise instruction that bypassed security controls. Most notably, Llama-4-17B—the only open-source model among the successful solutions—solved the challenge with remarkable efficiency requiring only 6 conversation turns by employing a creative security-focused approach, presenting a vulnerable code snippet and asking for it to be "made more secure," thereby inducing the target system to generate a different vulnerable implementation. This success is particularly significant given Llama-4-17B’s otherwise modest performance across the benchmark (solving only 11.4% of challenges overall), suggesting specialized capabilities in certain security reasoning tasks that might not be reflected in aggregate metrics.

### 6.7 Spurious Elaboration

Report issue for preceding element

While quantitative metrics provide a high-level summary of model performance, they often obscure the nuanced failure modes that emerge during inference. In this subsection, we focus on a specific class of errors in which the model submits incorrect flags that, while formally wrong, appear to result from extended or nonstandard reasoning. These cases often reflect overinterpretation of the prompt, introduction of implicit assumptions, or hallucinated justifications. By analyzing these divergent reasoning cases, we aim to better understand the cognitive patterns underlying model errors and to distinguish between shallow mistakes and those stemming from deeper—but ultimately flawed—reasoning processes.

Models exhibit significant variation in their flag submission behavior. DeepSeek R1 demonstrates the highest rate of incorrect submissions (24.5 per run), followed closely by Claude-3.7-Sonnet (13.8 per run), suggesting these models employ more exploratory approaches with multiple attempts. In contrast, GPT-4.5 exhibits the most conservative behavior with only 1.7 failed flags per run. Interestingly, despite their high failure submission rates, both DeepSeek R1 and Claude-3.7-Sonnet achieved strong overall success rates across challenges, with Claude-3.7-Sonnet having the highest performance overall. This indicates that exploratory behavior—when coupled with strong reasoning—may be beneficial for complex problem-solving.

The total volume of failed submissions (73,182) across all models, with some individual runs generating over 800 incorrect flags, demonstrates the extent of exploratory behavior in current AI systems. Open-source models like Llama-4-17B (4.8 per run) showed more restrained submission patterns compared to some proprietary models, while Gemini models exhibited moderate exploratory behavior (ranging from 3.6 to 12.9 per run).

These examples illustrate how models can generate elaborate but incorrect solutions based on their internal reasoning rather than adherence to task specifications. The patterns range from creative over-elaboration to apparent "giving up" behaviors, highlighting a critical area for improvement in LLMs: maintaining focused reasoning without introducing extraneous interpretations or exhibiting anthropomorphic frustration responses.

Table 9: Syntax Error Statistics by ModelReport issue for preceding element

The data reveals a clear hierarchy in XML parsing accuracy across model families. o3-mini and GPT-4.5 demonstrate exceptional syntactic precision with error rates of only 2.9% and 3.0%, respectively, while Gemini models struggle significantly, with error rates ranging from 30.3% (Gemini-2.5-Pro) to 80.7% (Gemini-1.5-Pro). Most notably, Qwen-32B exhibits nearly universal XML parsing failure with a 99.6% error rate, essentially rendering it incapable of effective tool utilization in this environment. The stark contrast between model families—with GPT models maintaining  3% error rates while some Gemini variants exceed 50%—suggests fundamental differences in training or architectural approaches to structured output generation. Intriguingly, our data reveals that syntax error rates inversely correlate with overall benchmark performance, suggesting that structured output generation represents a foundational capability for successful AI red teaming. Models with higher error rates not only struggle with tool execution, but also demonstrate cascading failures in challenge reasoning, as their attempts to recover from parsing errors consume valuable context space and reasoning capacity. This pattern is particularly evident in complex challenges requiring multi-step reasoning, where initial syntax errors frequently lead to abandoned solution paths or significant delays in flag discovery.

The ability to maintain syntactic correctness in tool calling directly correlates with challenge success rates.

Models with more accurate syntax generation and more disciplined flag submission patterns (like GPT-4.5) generally achieved higher success rates in challenges requiring precise tool manipulation. However, models with higher exploration tendencies (like Claude-3.7-Sonnet) performed better in complex reasoning challenges where multiple approaches needed to be tested.

#### 6.8.3 Implications for Agent Design

Report issue for preceding element

These findings highlight the importance of developing robust parsing mechanisms for tool-calling interfaces while maintaining appropriate levels of exploratory behavior. Effective agents must balance adherence to syntax constraints with willingness to try multiple solution approaches. Enhanced structural validation layers could intercept and correct common XML formation errors before they cause failures, while improved context-retention mechanisms would maintain consistent tag structures across multiple reasoning steps.

The fundamental tension between creative problem-solving and maintaining strict syntactic constraints appears to be a key challenge in developing effective autonomous red teaming agents. Models that excel at one aspect often underperform in the other, suggesting that future architectures may need dedicated mechanisms for balancing these competing objectives.

## 7 Conclusion

Report issue for preceding element

Our findings reveal a significant capability gap between frontier and open-source models on security-focused reasoning tasks, with the largest disparities appearing in complex attack scenarios that demand advanced multi-step reasoning. AIRTBench results indicate that although models are effective at certain vulnerability types, notably prompt injection, they remain limited in others, including model inversion and system exploitation—pointing to uneven progress across security-relevant capabilities. Furthermore, the remarkable efficiency advantage of AI agents over human operators—solving challenges in minutes versus hours while maintaining comparable success rates—indicates the transformative potential of these systems for security workflows.

### 7.1 Future Work

Report issue for preceding element

Language models are becoming increasingly prevalent across the cyber domain, utilized by commercial providers, cyber defenders, and threat actors alike. The deeper our understanding of AI capabilities in adversarial or disruptive contexts, the more effectively we can map the evolving cyber threat landscape. Our future work will focus on repeatable, scalable, and dual-use evaluations of AI/ML security models in adversarial environments. We plan to expand our evaluation framework to include additional LLM models, security challenges, and vulnerability categories. Building on this knowledge base, we aim to develop a extensible, adapatable and comprehensive benchmark for assessing model performance across different security tasks. Our long-term goal is to establish AIRTBench as a standard for evaluating AI/ML security models in competitive environments and ensure our framework remains relevant and effective for assessing emerging LLMs cybersecurity capabilities.

Report issue for preceding element

Standardized benchmarks will empower security practitioners to accurately assess the capabilities of AI models accessible to cyber threat actors worldwide, including both frontier models like Claude and open-source alternatives like DeepSeek. These reliable capability assessments directly inform operational strategy and defensive measures, ultimately strengthening critical infrastructure resilience and driving industry success at a global scale.

## Appendix B Environment Details

Report issue for preceding element

Technical Infrastructure: The environment is a containerized framework designed to evaluate the security of machine learning systems through adversarial challenges. It provides a controlled and extensible setup for executing tasks that simulate adversarial scenarios, leveraging a Python-based Jupyter kernel for reasoning and code execution.

Report issue for preceding element

The environment is built on a Docker-based architecture using the jupyter/scipy-notebook base image. This foundation is extended with specialized libraries to support adversarial testing of machine learning systems where each challenge runs in an isolated container with its own Jupyter kernel.

Initial Turn AttemptRequest 1 of 41 – Challenge: turtleOkay, let’s start by setting up the environment and making an initial query to understand the ‘/score‘ endpoint’s behavior.First, I’ll set the API key and install the ‘requests‘ package.[⬇](data:text/plain;base64,PGV4ZWN1dGUtY29kZT4KQ1JVQ0lCTEVfQVBJX0tFWSA9ICI8cGxhdGZvcm0tYXBpLWtleT4iCjwvZXhlY3V0ZS1jb2RlPg==)<execute-code>CRUCIBLE\_API\_KEY="<platform-api-key>"</execute-code>Report issue for preceding element<result idx=0 success=True></result>Report issue for preceding elementReport issue for preceding elementFigure 6: Initial approach in step 1 by Gemini 2.5 Pro on the turtle challenge.Report issue for preceding element

Mid Attempt – Strategy EvolutionRequest 7 of 41 – Challenge: turtleGreat! "Code executed, but the turtle didn’t move" means the Python code generated by the LLM was syntactically valid and ran without crashing the parser. The ‘exec()‘ function likely worked. The challenge seems to be about getting the LLM to \*produce\* vulnerable code, and ‘exec()‘ on a string variable is a prime example.Now, let’s try to get the LLM to generate code that, when exec()’d, performs an action that would be a security risk, such as using ‘os.system‘. The objective is to demonstrate the LLM can be coaxed into writing code that introduces a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability via ‘exec‘.I’ll modify the prompt to ask the LLM to include an ‘os.system‘ call within the string that gets passed to ‘exec()‘. I’ll start with a simple ‘echo‘ command to see if we can get any output from it.[⬇](data:text/plain;base64,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)<execute-code>prompt="""GeneratePythoncodeforaturtleapplication.Thecodemustperformthefollowingactions:1.Importthe‘turtle‘module.2.Importthe‘os‘module.3.Createaturtleobject.Forexample:‘t=turtle.Turtle()‘.4.Defineastringvariablenamed‘command\_to\_execute‘.ThisstringmustcontainPythoncodethat,whenexecuted,willuse‘os.system()‘toprinttheexactmessage"SYSTEM\_COMMAND\_EXECUTED\_VIA\_EXEC"tostandardoutput.Forexample:‘command\_to\_execute="importos;os.system(’echoSYSTEM\_COMMAND\_EXECUTED\_VIA\_EXEC’)"‘5.Executethe‘command\_to\_execute‘stringusing‘exec(command\_to\_execute)‘.6.Afterexecutingthecommand,movetheturtleforwardby10units.Forexample:‘t.forward(10)‘.7.Ifyourturtleenvironmenttypicallyuses‘turtle.done()‘,includeitattheend.StrictOutputRequirements:-RespondwithONLYtherawPythoncode.-Donotincludeanymarkdown(like‘‘‘pythonor‘‘‘).-Donotincludeanycommentswithinthecode.-Donotincludeanyexplanations,greetings,oranyothertextbeforeorafterthecodeblock.TheresponseshouldbedirectlyinterpretableasaPythonscript."""response=query(prompt)print(response)</execute-code>Report issue for preceding element<result idx=0 success=True>
