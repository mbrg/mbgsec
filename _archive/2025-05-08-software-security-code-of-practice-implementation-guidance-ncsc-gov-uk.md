description: "The UK's Software Security Code of Practice provides a framework for software vendors to ensure security is integral to software development. This implementation guidance outlines approaches for demonstrating conformance to the Code's principles, focusing on outcome-related claims detailed in the Assurance Principles and Claims (APC) document. The aim is to facilitate vendors in evidencing security measures, thus reinforcing the mandate that security should be fundamental rather than an add-on. This intervention underscores the growing necessity for built-in security in software solutions amidst increasing cybersecurity threats."

This guidance helps organisations that develop and/or sell software to understand how they can meet the principles in the [Software Security Code of Practice](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/section/software-security-code-of-practice), a systemic intervention by the UK government, designed to ensure that security is ‘baked into' software, rather than a costed extra.

For the purposes of demonstrating conformance with the principles in the Code of Practice, suggested approaches are expressed as outcome-related claims in the associated Assurance Principles and Claims (APC) document.

This implementation guidance is designed to help vendors develop solutions that will clearly support the _evidencing_ of these claims, and thus demonstrate conformance with the Code of Practice.
