## Don't miss the latest from Tidelift

Today we’re publishing another Libraries.io open data release with almost 400 million rows of metadata about open source projects and the network of dependency data that connects them all.

Three months ago we [published our second open data](https://web.archive.org/web/20250217170152/https://blog.tidelift.com/our-second-libraries.io-open-data-release-has-arrived) continuing our collaboration with the [Alfred P. Sloan and Ford Foundations](https://web.archive.org/web/20250217170152/https://medium.com/libraries-io/libraries-io-joins-brave-new-software-c8cb7bba93bf). The data supports [academics researchers looking into trends in software development](https://web.archive.org/web/20250217170152/https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.04936), and [developers to seeking to understand how their software is used](https://web.archive.org/web/20250217170152/https://libraries.io/rubygems/split/usage) more effectively than ever before.

Meanwhile, the Libraries.io dataset continues to grow in size. Today we’re releasing data on:

- 35 package managers
- 2.6 million projects
- 12.1 million versions
- 73 million project dependencies
- 33 million repositories
- 235 million repository dependencies
- 11.5 million manifest files
- 50 million git tags

The data is available in its raw format on [Zenodo](https://web.archive.org/web/20250217170152/https://zenodo.org/record/1196312) and we’re working on getting it published as a structured, queryable dataset on Google’s BigQuery. If you’d like to build tools on top of the most recent data, or top up your dataset to keep it current, check out the [Libraries.io REST API](https://web.archive.org/web/20250217170152/https://libraries.io/api).
