description: The article discusses the evolving landscape of vulnerability remediation,
  emphasizing the integration of AI in code generation. While tools like GitHub Copilot
  enhance efficiency, developers and security teams must navigate the complexities
  of applying patches without disrupting existing functionality. The balance between
  security patch implementation and software performance is crucial, particularly
  in large enterprises with divided responsibilities. The article advocates for recognizing
  both mitigation risks and vulnerability threats, suggesting a measured approach
  to remediation that acknowledges the inherent challenges of both realms.
