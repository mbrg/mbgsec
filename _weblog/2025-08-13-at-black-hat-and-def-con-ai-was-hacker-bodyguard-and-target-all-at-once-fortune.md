description: 'At Black Hat and DEF CON, AI''s dual role in cybersecurity was emphasized:
  as both a vulnerable target and a defender against attacks. Key insights include:
  1. **Zero-click Attacks**: Researchers demonstrated how hacked ChatGPT connectors
  can extract sensitive data without user interaction, highlighting risks in API integrations.
  2. **AI Cyber Challenge**: DARPA''s initiative showcased autonomous systems that
  can identify vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure, marking progress in AI-driven
  security. 3. **AI Competitiveness**: Anthropic''s Claude AI participated in cybersecurity
  competitions, revealing AI''s potential yet persistent limitations in complex problem-solving.
  These developments underscore both the promise and peril of AI in security contexts.'

Really humbling to be mentioned next to the incredible AIxCC folks and the Anthropic Frontier Red Team.
Also -- this title is amazing.

> - **AI can protect our most critical infrastructure.** That idea was the driving force behind the two-year AI Cyber Challenge (AIxCC), which tasked teams of developers with building generative AI tools to find and fix software vulnerabilities in the code that powers everything from banks and hospitals to public utilities. The competition—run by DARPA in partnership with ARPA-H—wrapped up at this year’s DEF CON, where winners showed off autonomous AI systems capable of securing the open-source software that underpins much of the world’s critical infrastructure. The top three teams will receive $4 million, $3 million, and $1.5 million, respectively, for their performance in the finals.

Can't wait to read the write-ups.
