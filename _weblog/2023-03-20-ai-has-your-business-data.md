description: "The integration of AI into low-code/no-code platforms, exemplified by\
  \ Microsoft\u2019s AI Copilot for Power Apps, dramatically reduces barriers for\
  \ business users to create applications leveraging organizational data. This trend\
  \ raises significant cybersecurity concerns, as unregulated access through user\
  \ impersonation can lead to unauthorized data exposure and credential sharing. With\
  \ business users empowered to create applications without IT oversight, security\
  \ professionals must rethink governance strategies and implement proactive guidance\
  \ to prevent potential data breaches linked to this democratization of app development.\
  \ The reliance on users' discretion amidst growing AI capabilities poses a critical\
  \ challenge for enterprise security models."
