  incorporating metadata on over 3.3 million packages across 37 package managers.
  The dataset reveals key trends, such as weekday-package release peaks and a disproportionate
  prevalence of MIT licenses over ISC. Notably, only 2.1% of npm dependencies are
  updated to the latest versions. This data fosters enhanced analytics capabilities
  via tools like Google BigQuery, facilitating deeper dependency analysis and trends
  in open-source software development. The dataset is licensed under Creative Commons
