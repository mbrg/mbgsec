description: "In \"To Map Shadow IT, Follow Citizen Developers,\" Michael Bargury\
  \ discusses the pervasive issue of shadow IT, where employees use unauthorized tools\
  \ to meet business needs. He emphasizes the dual role of citizen development\u2014\
  allowing users to create apps with low-code/no-code platforms while exposing potential\
  \ security risks. By tracing user-built applications and their integrations with\
  \ existing systems, organizations can better understand their shadow IT landscape.\
  \ This approach fosters a proactive stance in governance, balancing efficiency with\
  \ security, albeit requiring careful risk management to mitigate vulnerabilities."
