description: Generative AI is rapidly transforming business application development,
  especially through low-code/no-code platforms, allowing non-technical users to create
  applications autonomously. This democratization enhances productivity but escalates
  security risks, as non-experts make decisions on data storage and access. Security
  teams must evolve from traditional development oversight to encompass citizen developers.
  Automated guardrails are essential to manage risks while leveraging the capabilities
  of generative AI. With predictions of significant growth in low-code/no-code development,
  it's critical to prepare for the heightened security landscape this trend introduces.
