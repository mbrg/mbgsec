  \ is available under a Creative Commons BY-SA-4.0 license on Zenodo and will soon\
  \ be hosted in a structured format on Google BigQuery. This effort underscores the\
  \ necessity for community-driven solutions to support overburdened maintainers and\

I recently found this gem of a project. Looks like libraries.io was acquired by Tidelift that was acquired by Sonar, and is not abandoned. It's AGPL license preventing others to pick it up?

> For nearly three years, [Libraries.io](https://web.archive.org/web/20240325010337/https://libraries.io/) has been gathering data on the complex web of interdependency that exists in open source software. Weâ€™ve published a series of experiments using harvested metadata to highlight projects [in need of assistance](https://web.archive.org/web/20240325010337/https://libraries.io/help-wanted), [projects with too few contributors](https://web.archive.org/web/20240325010337/https://libraries.io/bus-factor) and [too little attention.](https://web.archive.org/web/20240325010337/https://libraries.io/digital-infrastructure)

This project has been going on from ~2016?
