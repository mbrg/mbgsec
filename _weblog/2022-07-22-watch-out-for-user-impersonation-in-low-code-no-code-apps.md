description: A recent article highlights significant cybersecurity risks associated
  with user impersonation in low-code/no-code applications. As employees bypass security
  protocols by sharing credentials for convenience, organizations face compromised
  user identities, undermining access control and compliance frameworks. A case study
  illustrates how such credential sharing led to security incidents, prompting a reevaluation
  of application design to safeguard user identities. This trend underscores the necessity
  for security teams to engage in the development of low-code applications, as they
  present unique risks that could exacerbate existing vulnerabilities within enterprise
  IT infrastructures.
