description: Recent concerns about low-code/no-code applications highlight significant
  security vulnerabilities in enterprise environments. Key issues include the lack
  of governance regarding data access (32%), trust in platform security (26%), inadequate
  application security knowledge (26%), and poor visibility into created applications
  (25%). IT security teams struggle with manual processes for monitoring and protecting
  these tools, which are often developed outside their purview. As enterprises adopt
  these platforms, an urgent need arises for tailored security solutions that align
  with low-code/no-code architectures, emphasizing the necessity for robust governance
  and proactive security measures.
