description: Forrester analysts predict significant security breaches in enterprises
  stemming from low-code/no-code (LCNC) applications in 2023. As business users increasingly
  leverage LCNC for critical app development, security teams must adapt, shifting
  perceptions of these applications from experiments to essential infrastructure.
  The potential for exploitation arises due to a lack of security expertise among
  citizen developers and possible vulnerabilities in LCNC platforms. This landscape
  underscores the need for robust security governance and proactive monitoring alongside
  empowering business users. Organizations must address these security gaps to mitigate
  risks associated with decentralized development in enterprise environments.
