description: Michael Bargury emphasizes the transformative potential of low-code/no-code
  platforms in enhancing cybersecurity mindshare among business users. By fostering
  collaboration and security awareness similar to DevSecOps achieved with developers,
  security teams can mitigate risks associated with shadow IT. As business units increasingly
  create critical applications independently, engaging these users early in the security
  dialogue is essential. This strategy aligns security as a business enabler, enabling
  smoother implementation of broader security initiatives like zero trust and identity
  systems. Addressing this shift presents a crucial opportunity for organizations
  to promote a holistic security culture.
