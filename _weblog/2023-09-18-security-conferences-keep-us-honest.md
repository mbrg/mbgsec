description: "Michael Bargury highlights the duality of cybersecurity research and\
  \ responsible disclosure at security conferences, using his Black Hat USA presentation\
  \ as a case study. He divulged vulnerabilities in Microsoft\u2019s Azure environment,\
  \ emphasizing that the shared responsibility model leaves customers needing to secure\
  \ their own systems. Bargury notes a shift from zero-day revelations to fostering\
  \ vendor accountability and transparency. He argues that public discourse can compel\
  \ organizations to prioritize security over public relations. This evolution in\
  \ vulnerability reporting underscores an ongoing need for collaboration between\
  \ researchers and vendors to enhance overall cybersecurity resilience."
