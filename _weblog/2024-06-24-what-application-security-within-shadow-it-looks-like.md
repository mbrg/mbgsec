description: 'Michael Bargury highlights the necessity of integrating application
  security (AppSec) within the burgeoning field of citizen development, particularly
  given the dramatic rise of shadow IT. A case study reveals two developers addressed
  70,000 vulnerabilities in three months, underscoring key strategies: thorough inventory
  management, clear policy frameworks, automated risk assessments, and an emphasis
  on self-service documentation. The challenge lies in harnessing non-security-savvy
  business users while fostering a security-first culture. As citizen development
  proliferates, effective AppSec solutions will increasingly rely on innovative automation
  and collaborative governance to mitigate risks without hindering business agility.'
