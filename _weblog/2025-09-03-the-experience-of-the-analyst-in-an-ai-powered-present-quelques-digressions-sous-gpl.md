description: 'The evolution of threat detection is transitioning from "detection as
  rules" to "detection as models," necessitating a convergence of cybersecurity expertise
  and advanced data science skills. Analysts must embrace AI capabilities while maintaining
  operational relevancy, as hands-on experience enhances detection accuracy and model
  training. The widening skills gap poses recruitment challenges, as demand for those
  proficient in both domains increases. Comprehensive AI training is required, emphasizing
  the need for junior engineers to cultivate foundational investigative skills. As
  the field matures, integrating AI into security engineering will become paramount
  for effective threat detection. Tags: AI, cybersecurity, detection engineering,

Interesting primer on detection engineering being pushed into different directions: operational, engineering and science.

> But I would also like to see the operational aspect more seriously considered by our junior folks. It takes years to acquire the mental models of a senior analyst, one who is able to effectively identify threats and discard false positives. If we want security-focused AI models to get better and more accurate, we need the people who train them to have deep experiences in cybersecurity.

There's a tendency of young engineers to go and build a platform before the understand the first use case. Understanding comes from going deep into messy reality.

> Beyond the “detection engineers is software engineering” idea is the “security engineering is an AI science discipline” concept. Transforming our discipline is not going to happen overnight, but it is undeniably the direction we’re heading.

These two forces pool in VERY different directions. I think one of the most fundamental issues we have with AI in cybersecurity is stepping away from determinism. Running experiments with non-definitive answers.
