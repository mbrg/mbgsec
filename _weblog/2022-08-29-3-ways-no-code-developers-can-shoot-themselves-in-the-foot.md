description: 'The rise of no-code/low-code platforms affords business users significant
  autonomy but introduces critical cybersecurity risks. This article highlights three
  scenarios that demonstrate potential pitfalls: unauthorized data sharing with vendors,
  mishandling of sensitive information (e.g., credit card details), and evasion of
  corporate email security through automation. These examples underscore the necessity
  for organizations to implement robust security frameworks, educate users about their
  responsibilities, and monitor developments to mitigate risks associated with citizen
  development. Without proper oversight, enterprises risk severe compliance violations
  and data breaches, necessitating a proactive security posture.'
