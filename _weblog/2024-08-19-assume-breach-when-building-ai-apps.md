description: In "Assume Breach When Building AI Apps," Michael Bargury emphasizes
  the inevitability of AI jailbreaks, urging developers to design applications with
  the understanding that such exploits are a matter of context, not mere vulnerabilities.
  The rise of AI jailbreaking communities highlights the ease with which these bypasses
  can be discovered, outpacing defensive strategies. Bargury advocates for proactive
  oversight rather than reliance on perimeter defenses, suggesting monitoring systems
  capable of rapid response to potential exploits, framing AI as an unpredictable
  asset that requires diligent governance. This perspective is crucial for developers
  and security professionals adapting to AI's growing role in enterprise applications.
