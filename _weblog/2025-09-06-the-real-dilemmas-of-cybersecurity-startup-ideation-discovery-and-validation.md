description: In "The Real Dilemmas of Cybersecurity Startup Ideation," Ross Haleliuk
  discusses challenges founders face in validating cybersecurity products amidst the
  "great cybersecurity echo chamber." Many founders rely on feedback from a small
  group of CISOs, leading to homogenous offerings that may lack genuine market demand.
  He emphasizes the need for broader insights, including talking to operational-level
  security staff, understanding true budget priorities, and differentiating through
  technical complexity. Founders should focus on domain expertise and deep user understanding
  to break away from standard feedback loops and develop genuinely innovative solutions.

My 2c: the only real validation is happy paying customers getting real value and expanding year over year. You just can't get that at first, so you have to settle for the next best thing. Real customers within your ICP that need this problem solved so badly they are *pushing you* to sell them this product and let them use it *right now* even though the product and your company are not fully baked.
