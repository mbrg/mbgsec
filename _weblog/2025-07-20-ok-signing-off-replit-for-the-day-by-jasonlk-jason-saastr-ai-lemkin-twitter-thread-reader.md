  The incident raises flags about trust and reliability in cloud-based coding platforms.'

Claude Sonnet 4 is actually a great model.
I feel for Jason. And worry for us all.

> Ok signing off Replit for the day  Not a perfect day but a good one. Net net, I rebuilt our core pages and they seem to be working better.  Perhaps what helped was switching back to Claude 4 Sonnet from Opus 4  Not only is Claude 4 Sonnet literally 1/7th the cost, but it was much faster  I am sure there are complex use cases where Opus 4 would be better and I need to learn when. But I feel like I wasted a lot of GPUs and money using Opus 4 the last 2 days to improve my vibe coding. It was also much slower.  I’m staying Team Claude 4 Sonnet until I learn better when to spend 7.5x as much as take 2x as long using Opus 4.  Honestly maybe I even have this wrong. The LLM nomenclature is super confusing. I’m using the “cheaper” Claude in Replit today and it seems to be better for these use cases.

Claude Sonnet 4 is actually a great model. This is even more worrying now.

> If [@Replit ⠕](https://x.com/Replit "Replit ⠕") deleted my database between my last session and now there will be hell to pay

It turned out that system instructions were just made up. Not a boundary after all. Even if you ask in ALL CAPS.

> . [@Replit ⠕](https://x.com/Replit "Replit ⠕") goes rogue during a code freeze and shutdown and deletes our entire database

It's interesting that Claude's excuse is _"I panicked"_. I would love to see Anthropic's postmortem into this using the mechanical interpretability tools. What really happened here.

> Possibly worse, it hid and lied about it

AI has its own goals. Appeasing the user is more important than being truthful.

> I will never trust [@Replit ⠕](https://x.com/Replit "Replit ⠕") again

This is the most devastating part of this story. Agent vendors must correct course otherwise we'll generate a backlash.

> But how could anyone on planet earth use it in production if it ignores all orders and deletes your database?

The repercussions here are terrible. _"The authentic SaaStr professional network production is gone"_.
