description: The September 2025 update of the ATLAS framework introduces version 4.6.0,
  emphasizing Agentic AI TTPs in collaboration with Zenity. The data upgrade to v5.0.0
  includes a new "Technique Maturity" field, evaluating techniques on feasibility,
  demonstration, and real-world application. Notable additions include techniques
  for AI agent context poisoning, credential harvesting, and data exfiltration via
  AI tools. The release enhances the repository with practical insights, including
  a new case study on circumventing ML phishing detection. This development reflects
