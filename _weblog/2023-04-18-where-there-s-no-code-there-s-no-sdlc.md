description: The rise of low-code/no-code development poses significant challenges
  to traditional software development life cycle (SDLC) security practices. This paradigm
  shift enables business users to rapidly build applications without formal coding,
  bypassing critical security gates established in SDLCs. To mitigate risks, organizations
  must adapt by embedding security directly within these platforms, ensuring ease
  of use for non-technical users while upholding security and compliance standards.
  Cross-industry frameworks are emerging to address these new dynamics, highlighting
  the necessity of guiding citizen developers in secure application creation to maintain
  effective governance without stifling productivity.
