description: The rise of generative AI (GenAI) necessitates a structured security
  framework for enterprises to manage their rapidly developing AI applications. As
  companies race to leverage GenAI for productivity gains, security teams must address
  inherent vulnerabilities, including identity management and threat modeling, particularly
  for evolving frameworks like LangChain and AutoGPT. A centralized security resource
  can aid in the inventory, assessment, and monitoring of these applications, enhancing
  overall security posture. Organizations must adapt quickly to ensure secure development
  practices while navigating a diverse ecosystem of AI tools.
