description: The article examines the feasibility of attaining 100% security guarantees
  through formal verification methods. Major cloud providers like Amazon and Microsoft
  have begun commoditizing these capabilities in response to persistent issues like
  IAM misconfigurations. Formal methods utilize mathematical proofs to assert bug-free
  code, yet their implementation is complex and resource-intensive, often limited
  to critical software. The implications for organizations include a potential paradigm
  shift in evaluating security solutions but caution against over-reliance on absolute
  claims due to coverage and definition challenges. This could drive innovation but
  necessitates careful consideration of risk management strategies.
