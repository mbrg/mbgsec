description: Michael Bargury emphasizes the necessity for security teams to adapt
  as low-code/no-code (LCNC) development rises, expecting a 20% market growth in 2023.
  As business units increasingly create critical applications independently, conflicts
  with security teams may arise. He advises security professionals to engage proactively,
  understanding LCNC-specific risks, and to foster collaboration. Key strategies include
  conducting security assessments, identifying risk hotspots, and positioning themselves
  as enablers of innovation rather than obstacles. By aligning with business objectives
  and learning their operations, security can contribute to resilience in an evolving
  tech landscape.
