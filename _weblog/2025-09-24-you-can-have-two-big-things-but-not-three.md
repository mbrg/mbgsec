  \ effectively pursue only two significant endeavors\u2014a concept he terms \"Big\
  \ Things.\" This limitation arises from the finite nature of time, particularly\
  \ the structured 24-hour day. Dependencies between commitments such as work, family,\
  \ and personal pursuits illustrate the resulting trade-offs. Imbalanced allocation\
  \ leads to neglect in areas, often endangering personal relationships. For entrepreneurs,\
  \ initiating a startup frequently becomes untenable without prioritizing it over\
  \ other endeavors. The underlying implication underscores the necessity for strategic\
  \ prioritization in professional and personal life to avoid burnout and relational\
  \ strain."

I think this is a good way to tell people that you can't have it all. But you can, in fact, have more than two things. Just not at the same time.
