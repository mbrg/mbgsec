description: The emergence of enterprise-level generative AI tools, such as OpenAI's
  custom GPTs and Microsoft's Copilot Studio, enables business users to easily create
  AI applications using organizational data. These tools facilitate user impersonation,
  complicating security oversight, as AI actions become indistinguishable from legitimate
  user activities. Security teams must shift focus from traditional monitoring to
  integrating strategies that account for citizen-developed applications, particularly
  as low-code/no-code platforms proliferate. Adopting industry standards for assessing
  risks associated with these applications will be crucial for maintaining security
  in an evolving landscape dominated by agile AI development.
