description: Researchers at NYU have developed an AI-powered ransomware prototype
  named "PromptLocker." This tool mimics standard ransomware functionality by targeting
  specific data, exfiltrating it, and encrypting volumes. While currently a research
  project, its capabilities highlight the potential of AI in automating sophisticated
  cyberattacks. The implications underscore the need for enhanced security measures
  and adaptive defenses against rapidly evolving AI-driven threats in the cybersecurity
  landscape.

Jumping the gun to declare the first AI-powered malware shows how immature we are in AI being a real threat. Too bad this content was not extracted well by my automation.
