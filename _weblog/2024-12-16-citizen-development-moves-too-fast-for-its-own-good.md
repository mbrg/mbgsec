description: The rise of low-code/no-code platforms accelerates application development
  but introduces significant security risks. These tools allow non-technical users
  to create applications rapidly, often bypassing established security protocols.
  The article emphasizes that while empowering citizen developers enhances productivity,
  it increases the likelihood of unintentional data exposure, particularly in automations
  involving sensitive information. The author advocates for implementing automated
  guardrails to prompt users to reconsider their actions, thus balancing speed and
  security without stifling innovation. This highlights the need for proactive governance
  in emergent development environments.
