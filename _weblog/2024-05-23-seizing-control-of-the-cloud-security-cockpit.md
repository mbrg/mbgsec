description: The article highlights the critical role of secure configuration management
  in cloud and SaaS environments, likening current practices to an unregulated cockpit.
  Misconfiguration remains a key cause of security vulnerabilities, exacerbated by
  fluid user interfaces and the decentralized nature of decision-making. The piece
  advocates for standardized practices to consolidate disparate efforts in mitigating
  these risks, suggesting that aligned industry standards could significantly reduce
  misconfiguration incidents. Continuous change in service functionalities adds complexity,
  necessitating robust security governance frameworks to handle evolving threats and
  configurations effectively.
