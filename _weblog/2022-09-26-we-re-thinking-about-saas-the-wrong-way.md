description: Michael Bargury argues that the traditional separation of SaaS and public
  cloud security hinders effective risk management as low-code SaaS platforms evolve
  into business-centric application development solutions. With business users increasingly
  acting as developers, applications built on these platforms require the same rigorous
  security measures applied to cloud-hosted applications. This shift necessitates
  a reevaluation of security strategies to include the myriad applications stemming
  from enterprise SaaS, which currently lack adequate visibility and governance, thus
  exposing organizations to heightened cyber risks.

Many enterprise applications are built outside of IT, but we still treat the platforms they're built with as point solutions.
