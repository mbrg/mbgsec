[AWS security blog](https://aws.amazon.com/security/security-bulletins/aws-2025-016/) confirms the attacker gained access to a write token and abused it to inject the malicious prompt.
This confirms our [earlier findings](https://www.mbgsec.com/posts/2025-07-24-constructing-a-timeline-for-amazon-q-prompt-infection/).

In fact, this token gave the attacked write access to AWS Toolkit, IDE Extension and Amazon Q.

The blog also details that the attacker gained access by exploiting a vulnerability in the CodeBuild and using memory dump to grab the tokens. 
That confirms our [suspicion](https://x.com/mbrg0/status/1949001616230649904).

A key question remains -- how did the attacker compromise this token?

## Evidence are getting deleted, fast

[Our earlier findings](https://www.mbgsec.com/posts/2025-07-24-constructing-a-timeline-for-amazon-q-prompt-infection/) were based on analysis of GH Archive and the Github user `lkmanka58`. 
GH Archive gives us commit SHAs.
Github never forgets SHAs. 
So we can always looks at the commit's code even if the branch or tag gets deleted. 
In our case, this was instrumental to find and analyze (1) the `stability` tag where the attacker hid the prompt payload, (2) `lkmanka58`'s prior activity.

On that second point:

Since the user `lkmanka58` is now delete along with their repos, we can no long look at the code of this repo.
Fortunately, I looked at it yesterday before it got deleted.
On June 13th `lkmanka58` created a repo `lkmanka58/code_whisperer` playing around with `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4` trying to assume role `arn:aws:iam::975050122078:role/code_whisperer`.

![GH Archive reveals three push events to lkmanka58's now-deleted repository](/assets/images/2025-07-26-tracking-down-the-amazon-q-attacker-through-deleted-prs/Gww-oRoWIAA-FJa.jpeg)

**This led me down this goose chase.
Before you go on, please know that this thread doesn't end with any new and meaningful information.
Just more open threads.
I'm sharing this hoping that others can join in pulling on them.**

## Deletions leave a noisy trace

These deletions gave me an idea.
In the [404media article](https://www.404media.co/hacker-plants-computer-wiping-commands-in-amazons-ai-coding-agent/) The attacker claimed to gain access through a PR late June.
But `lkmanka58` did not create any PR to the `aws/aws-toolkit-vscode` repo.
A dead end.
Or is it?

GH Archive remembers everything, including 125 PRs created in `aws/aws-toolkit-vscode` in June.
See SQL query below (_"Get all `aws/aws-toolkit-vscode` PRs created in June"_).

![125 PRs to `aws/aws-toolkit-vscode` created in June](/assets/images/2025-07-26-tracking-down-the-amazon-q-attacker-through-deleted-prs/prs_in_june.png)

Let's see which ones are still up on GitHub:

![A couple of couple are missing!](/assets/images/2025-07-26-tracking-down-the-amazon-q-attacker-through-deleted-prs/ping_prs.png)

PRs [#5120](https://github.com/aws/aws-toolkit-vscode/pull/5120) and [#5123](https://github.com/aws/aws-toolkit-vscode/pull/5123) were deleted from github.

GOT YOU.
[Future Michael: I didn't really get them.]

We just found a NEW user `Frank97Tyler` who pushed two since-deleted PRs to `aws/aws-toolkit-vscode`.
The PRs were pushed within 10 minutes of eachother `2024-06-08T17:52:21Z` `2024-06-08T18:02:49Z`.
In June 8th (not late June like the attacker claimed in the 404media article).
PR titles are very suspicious `Codespace fluffy space memory wrvrwwxwvrqrc9xwg` and `Create devcontainer.json`.
Note `console.python/log` written into the body of the second PR.

This is an [official](https://mcr.microsoft.com/en-us/artifact/mar/devcontainers/universal/tags) Microsoft devcontainer.
How bad this could be?

### Workflows

I couldn't find any indication that these PRs triggered a GitHub workflow.

## This ends with more questions

We found no indications of compromise.
But a whole lot of threads to pull for the curious.

- A key question remains -- how did the attacker compromise this token?

- Is `Frank97Tyler` related to `lkmanka58`?

- If not, why were their PRs, issues and user deleted?
